 
director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless 
you count some farting , a little puking , and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil' romeo . 
1 : 30 - pg for some bullying and crude humor
