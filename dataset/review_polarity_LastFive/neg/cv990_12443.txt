 
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . 
this movie could have been so much better . 
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . 
there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser .
