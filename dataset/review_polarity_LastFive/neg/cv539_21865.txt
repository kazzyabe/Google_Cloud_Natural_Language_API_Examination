 
this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . 
in a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . 
but without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . 
this film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted " you are a ! $@^@ * ^ 
choir boy ! ! " 
for two hours .
