 
i also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . 
but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . 
a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . 
the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to .
