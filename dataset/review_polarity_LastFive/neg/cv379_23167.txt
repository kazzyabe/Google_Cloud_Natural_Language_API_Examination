 
there's a " halloween h2k " in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in " h20 , " and a " freddy vs . jason " has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were " killed off . " 
there's bound to be a " scream 4 " someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . 
bottom line : they should have called this one " yawn . " 
.
