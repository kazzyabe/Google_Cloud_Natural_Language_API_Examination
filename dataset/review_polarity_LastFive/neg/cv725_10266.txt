 
unfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film . 
the plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . 
carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . 
this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying .
