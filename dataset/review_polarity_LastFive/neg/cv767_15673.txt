 
here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . 
in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . 
star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . 
i'm not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again .
