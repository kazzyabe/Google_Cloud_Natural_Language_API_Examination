 
all of these aspects of the film , needless to say , seriously offended me as a wrestling fan . 
another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan ) . 
wouldn't it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair's insistance ? 
i hate that cliche ! 
the world wrestling federation would have made a better film . 
they are the promotion everyone cares about , they are winning the ratings , they have better wrestlers , and they take their fans into consideration and don't treat fans like morons . 
so , vince , how about a movie ?
