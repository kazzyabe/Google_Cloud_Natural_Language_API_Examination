 
i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . 
but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . 
if you're in for some fun action , rent sly's earlier " demolition man , " which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . 
skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger's accent , or see stone's breasts again .
