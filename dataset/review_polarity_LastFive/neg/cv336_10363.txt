 
as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . 
 ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a " bad movie " sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction . 
ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either .
