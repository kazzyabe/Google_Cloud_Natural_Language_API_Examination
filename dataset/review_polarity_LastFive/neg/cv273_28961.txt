 
it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . 
in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . 
that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . 
unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .
