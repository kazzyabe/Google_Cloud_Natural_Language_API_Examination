 
not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight , the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck . 
enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection . 
i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me . 
somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .
