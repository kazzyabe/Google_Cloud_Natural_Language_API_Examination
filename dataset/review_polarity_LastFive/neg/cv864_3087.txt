 
there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . 
but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . 
this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . 
a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .
