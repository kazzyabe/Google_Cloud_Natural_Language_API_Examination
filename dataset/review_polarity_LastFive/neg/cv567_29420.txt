 
as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . 
and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . 
at least he's friends with wes anderson . 
bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . 
.
