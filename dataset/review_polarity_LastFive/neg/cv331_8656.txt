 
he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here . 
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . 
but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . 
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us . "
