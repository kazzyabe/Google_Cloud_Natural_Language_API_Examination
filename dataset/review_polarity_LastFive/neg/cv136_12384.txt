 
by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . 
the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . 
 " lost in space " is major film production at its worst . 
it's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .
