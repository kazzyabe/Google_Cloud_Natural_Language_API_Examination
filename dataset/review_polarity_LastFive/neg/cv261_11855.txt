 
movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . 
and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . 
children are not muppets . 
and spawn unapologetically targets children .
