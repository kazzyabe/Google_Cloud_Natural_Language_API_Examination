 
it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . 
shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . 
the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . 
i'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though .
