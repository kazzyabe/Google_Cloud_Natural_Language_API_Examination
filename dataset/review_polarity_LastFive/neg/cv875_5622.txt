 
oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . 
about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . 
however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . 
this is not a good movie .
