 
eh he he he " the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg . 
he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . 
he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like " i really don't like that guy " every time he fails to kill luc . 
sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video .
