 
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . 
stealing from " alien " , " the abyss " and the disastrous " event horizon " , this film has learned nothing from them . 
remarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is " wag the dog " , a smart and entertaining piece of work . 
this one could have been titled the same sans one word .
