 
working from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . 
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography , luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity . 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " american outlaws " is a galloping , formulaic 3 . 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie .
