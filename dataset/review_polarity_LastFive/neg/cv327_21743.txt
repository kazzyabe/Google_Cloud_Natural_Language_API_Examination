 
`the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . 
you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ? 
o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? ' 
in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . 
after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . 
o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge .
