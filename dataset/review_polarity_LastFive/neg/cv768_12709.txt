of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . 
the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? 
isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ? 
the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . 
well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .
