 
the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . 
there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . 
savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . 
it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying .
