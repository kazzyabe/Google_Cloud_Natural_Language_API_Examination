 
the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . 
but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble . 
the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . 
but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .
