 " 
maybe this has just been a bad year for children's films , and hopefully , the upcoming , " the prince of egypt , " will not be a disappointment . 
as for , " a bug's life , " i did not enjoy anything about it . 
not the story , not the characters , and not even the voiceover work , which was far more lively in , " antz . " 
 " a bug's life , " goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , " i'll be home for christmas . "
