 
8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . 
with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . 
ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . 
and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .
