 
plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents . 
the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . 
the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . 
producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .
