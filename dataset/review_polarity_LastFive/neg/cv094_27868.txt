 
the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . 
the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . 
danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe . 
while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .
