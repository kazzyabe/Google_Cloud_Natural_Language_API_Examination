 
brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . 
summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . 
but it's also empty , pretentious and boring . 
like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .
