 " 
drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . 
students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind " final fantasy : the spirits within , " but i found it sub-par across the board . 
 " futurama " does more effective battle visuals , the kids in " south park " are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of " the outer limits " does better doom and gloom sci-fi . 
so who needs this ? 
not me .
