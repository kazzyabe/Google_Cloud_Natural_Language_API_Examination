 
there's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . 
although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . 
sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . 
give it a miss .
