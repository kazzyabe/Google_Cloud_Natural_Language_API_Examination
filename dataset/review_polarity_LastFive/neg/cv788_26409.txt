 
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . 
and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . 
with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . 
i can't say either for " the way of the gun , " because it has very little going for it and i can't imagine anyone intelligently defending it .
