 
 " out for justice " just proves once again that american action films just suck . 
i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo . 
but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don't bother watching this . 
it's so stupid that it's boring .
