 
they cried . 
they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well . 
this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . 
i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better . 
until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr
