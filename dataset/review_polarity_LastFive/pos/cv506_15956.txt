 
the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . 
the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . 
more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . 
by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .
