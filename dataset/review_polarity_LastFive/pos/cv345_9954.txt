 
it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . 
in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little " fake . " 
whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake . 
but perhaps it isn't a mistake .
