 
in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . 
and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . 
i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . 
then i would have had something to hold me over even now .
