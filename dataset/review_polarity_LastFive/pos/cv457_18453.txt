 
that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . 
still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point . 
the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn't mind doing again . 
while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ? 
the film is pure fun from beginning to end . 
and isn't that what really matters ?
