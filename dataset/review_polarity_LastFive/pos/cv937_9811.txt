 
as we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . 
this is an individual's fight for self-advancement . 
we don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . 
it's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not .
