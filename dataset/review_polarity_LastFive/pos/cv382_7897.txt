 
pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . 
along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . 
and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . 
surely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .
