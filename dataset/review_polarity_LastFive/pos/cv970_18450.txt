 
strengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . 
the film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . 
bottom line ? 
seeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . 
we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months .
