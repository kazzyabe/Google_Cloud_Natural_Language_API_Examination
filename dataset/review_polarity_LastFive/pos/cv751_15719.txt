 
life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . 
however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . 
with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . 
it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year .
