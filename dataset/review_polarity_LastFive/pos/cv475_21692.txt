 
the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . 
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' . 
while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it . 
'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . 
all kevin smith fans must see ! !
