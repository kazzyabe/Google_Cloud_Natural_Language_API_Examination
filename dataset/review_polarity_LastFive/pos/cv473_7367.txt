 
the martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable . 
the film is a million times better then the dire independance day , and is a real tribute to the tacky '50s invasion movies . 
they are is a great score by danny elfman , and lots of laughs . 
this has to be the best invasion i've seen for a long time .
