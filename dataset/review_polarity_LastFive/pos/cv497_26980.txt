 
more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . 
the ending itself is great . 
it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good . 
you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . 
i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?
