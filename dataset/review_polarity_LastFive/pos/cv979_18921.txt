 
luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable . 
with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . 
i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . 
and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .
