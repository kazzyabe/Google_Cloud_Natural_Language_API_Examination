 
willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . 
truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and " wag the dog " at least succeeds in this respect . 
however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . 
then again , it's a valiant effort .
