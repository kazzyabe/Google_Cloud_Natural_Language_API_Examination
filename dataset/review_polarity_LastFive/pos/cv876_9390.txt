 
some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . 
i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile . 
the strange thing is that it works . 
garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .
