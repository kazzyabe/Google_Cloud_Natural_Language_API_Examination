 
one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . 
however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . 
it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . 
the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .
