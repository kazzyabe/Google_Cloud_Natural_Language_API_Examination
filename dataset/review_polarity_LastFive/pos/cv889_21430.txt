 
i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . 
instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . 
house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . 
though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . 
but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !
