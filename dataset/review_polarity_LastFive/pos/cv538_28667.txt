 
there is a patent feel to the look of " snatch " and " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " that reeks of " signature " for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works . 
there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions . 
nonetheless , " snatch " is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot . 
i give it a b+ .
