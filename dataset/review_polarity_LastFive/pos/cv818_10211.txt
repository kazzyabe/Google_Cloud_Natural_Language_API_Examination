 
the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . 
tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . 
when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . 
it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .
