 
also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . 
he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . 
the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . 
and from this , i had a great time watching the movie .
