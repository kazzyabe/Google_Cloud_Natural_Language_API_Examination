 
i'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . 
although the wait is unfortunate , it's good to know that it's being released at all , for " kiki's delivery service " is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . 
watch this movie . 
along with " man bites dog , " and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen .
