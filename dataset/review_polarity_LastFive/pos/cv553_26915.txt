 
the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . 
as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . 
one thing seems clear , though . 
shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .
