 
a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style . 
but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it . 
director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) . 
it's not great jackie chan , but it's jackie chan , and that's enough . 
up next : jay and silent bob strike back 
.
