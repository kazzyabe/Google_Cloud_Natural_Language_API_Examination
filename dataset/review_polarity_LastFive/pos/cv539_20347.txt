 
i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more . 
you have to see it for yourself . 
i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . 
could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? 
or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? 
well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . 
no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is !
