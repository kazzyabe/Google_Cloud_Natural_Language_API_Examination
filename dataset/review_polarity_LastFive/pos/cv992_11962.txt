 
i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . 
director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . 
medak has also mastered the wonderful " jump ! " 
moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . 
strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .
