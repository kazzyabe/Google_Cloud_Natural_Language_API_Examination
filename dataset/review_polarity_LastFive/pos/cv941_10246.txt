 
her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year . 
it is not clear what michelles martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . 
of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , " wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . " 
my own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice .
