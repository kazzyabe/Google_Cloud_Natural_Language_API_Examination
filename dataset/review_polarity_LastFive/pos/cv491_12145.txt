 
the ending is a bit too pat . 
everything is tied up with a neat little bow . 
rosie o'donnell is a stand-out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and " tell it like it is " pronouncements . 
structured somewhat like a " diner , a few years later " , this feel-good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice .
