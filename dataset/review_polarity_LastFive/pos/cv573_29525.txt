 
but the star of this show , without a doubt , is the remarkable tilda swinton . 
watch the shadings , depth , resource , vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her . 
days after my second viewing of " the deep end , " i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water . 
 " the deep end " is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it .
