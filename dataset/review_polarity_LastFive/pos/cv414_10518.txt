 
overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . 
some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . 
in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these " offensive " words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . 
go see the film and see what i mean .
