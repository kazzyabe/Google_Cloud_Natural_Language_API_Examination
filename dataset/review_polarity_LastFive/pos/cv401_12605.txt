 
bloomin' farce . 
it was deserving in a number of departments , though . 
last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? 
nope , i don't think so . 
it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . 
and as for the fact they're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !
