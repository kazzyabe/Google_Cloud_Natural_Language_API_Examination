 
though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . 
sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . 
if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . 
this film is best watched on the big-screen .
