 
tony todd ( 1992's " candyman " ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . 
and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . 
ultimately , what is so good about " final destination " is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films . 
if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .
