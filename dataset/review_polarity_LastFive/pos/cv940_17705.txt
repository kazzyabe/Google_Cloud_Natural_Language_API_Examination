 
in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called " real life " in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . 
the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . 
as with most films by albert brooks , " real life " was funny , but absurd . 
the funniest--and scariest--thing about " edtv " is that it is absolutely believable .
