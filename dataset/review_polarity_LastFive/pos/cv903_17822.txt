 
i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . 
i even liked the trite " in the south everybody is related to everybody " cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . 
i'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . 
perhaps it's that good ol' southern charm .
