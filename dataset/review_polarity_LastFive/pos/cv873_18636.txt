 
music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . 
it's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . 
at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . 
notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . 
for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?
