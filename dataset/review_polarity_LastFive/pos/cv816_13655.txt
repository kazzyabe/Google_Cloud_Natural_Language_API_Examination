 
but that's a good sign : mafia ! 
is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .

i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . 
finally , a film that does this for me .
