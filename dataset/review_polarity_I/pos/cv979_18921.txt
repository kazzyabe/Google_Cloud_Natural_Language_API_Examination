 
it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film . 
one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . 
and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .
