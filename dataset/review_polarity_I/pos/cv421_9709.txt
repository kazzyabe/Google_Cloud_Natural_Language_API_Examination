 
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . 
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . 
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . " 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . 
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . 
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects . 
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . 
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . 
perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen . 
believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film . 
it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .
