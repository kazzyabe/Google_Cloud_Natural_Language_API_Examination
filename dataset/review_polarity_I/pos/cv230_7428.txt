well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started . 
with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' 
i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . 
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . 
another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about " well thats not really possible . " 
you know what ? 
i couldn't give a bloody damn if it's possible or not , really i couldn't . 
it's a freaking movie and i don't want reality thrown in my face . 
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground .
