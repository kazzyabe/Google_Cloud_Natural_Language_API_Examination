 
i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . 
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it . 
however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian .
