city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . 
i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . " 
 ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . 
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . 
since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect . 
what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation .
