 
i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn't anyone realize how irritating tucker's incessant ranting and raving was ? 
if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films . 
but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it . 
director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) .
