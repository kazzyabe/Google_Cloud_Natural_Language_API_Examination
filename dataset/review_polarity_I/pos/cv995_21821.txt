 
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . 
from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . 
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore .
