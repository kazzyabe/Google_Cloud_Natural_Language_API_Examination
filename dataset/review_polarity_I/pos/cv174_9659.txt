no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . 
the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! 
i can't stand this anymore ! ' . 
my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon .
