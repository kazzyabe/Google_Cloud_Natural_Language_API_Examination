 " desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 . 
now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film . 
how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? 
what's the greater good here ? 
many lives or one life ? 
if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character . 
even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . 
so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest .
