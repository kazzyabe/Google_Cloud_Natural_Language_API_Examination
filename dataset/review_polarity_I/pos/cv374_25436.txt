 
the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . 
when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . 
how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? 
well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . 
what planet are your from ? 
was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video .
