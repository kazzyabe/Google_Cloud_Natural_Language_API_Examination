 
yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . 
i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . 
so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , " so i signed up . 
all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either . 
rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? 
you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .
