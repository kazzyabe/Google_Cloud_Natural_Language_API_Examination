 
the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 
watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 
i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) .
