 
while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . 
american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . 
i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . 
the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . 
and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . 
besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . 
the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? 
i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . 
in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . 
however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .
