 
every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . 
on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .
