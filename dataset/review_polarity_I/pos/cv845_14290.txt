when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . 
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . 
like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . 
heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . 
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .
