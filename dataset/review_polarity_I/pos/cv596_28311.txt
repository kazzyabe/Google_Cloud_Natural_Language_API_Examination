 
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films . 
i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be . 
i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year . 
at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds .
