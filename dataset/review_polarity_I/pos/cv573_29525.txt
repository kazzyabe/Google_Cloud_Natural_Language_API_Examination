 " 
i've neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details . 
many reviews of " the deep end " describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder . 
days after my second viewing of " the deep end , " i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water .
