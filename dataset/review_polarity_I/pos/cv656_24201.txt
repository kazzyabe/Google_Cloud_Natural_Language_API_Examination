 
the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . 
even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . 
as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . 
they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .
