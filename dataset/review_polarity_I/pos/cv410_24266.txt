 
now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . 
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels . 
the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . 
oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .
