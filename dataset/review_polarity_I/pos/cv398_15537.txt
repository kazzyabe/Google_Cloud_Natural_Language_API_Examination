 
when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . 
if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . 
this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . 
or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .
