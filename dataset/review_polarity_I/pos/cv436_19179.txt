 
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . 
not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence . 
if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? 
personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology .
