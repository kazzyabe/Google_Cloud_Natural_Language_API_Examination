i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture . 
and i think that lumet's " 12 angry men " , wilder's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . 
but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents .
