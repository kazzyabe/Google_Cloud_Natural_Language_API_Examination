 
it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . 
and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? 
no . okay , 
well i just did ! 
i coulda done without her whole " romance " angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . 
of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . 
and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . 
trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me .
