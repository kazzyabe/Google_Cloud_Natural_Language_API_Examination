i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . 
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , " i love you , " and john replies with , " i know you think you do . 
it's the kind that goes something like , " yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . 
when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , " and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! " 
you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . 
john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron .
