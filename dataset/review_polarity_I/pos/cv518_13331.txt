first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . 
i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . 
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . 
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . 
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .
