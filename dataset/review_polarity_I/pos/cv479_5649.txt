 
acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . 
id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . 
if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . 
sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was .
