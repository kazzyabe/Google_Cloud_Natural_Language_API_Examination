when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " . 
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . 
as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters .
