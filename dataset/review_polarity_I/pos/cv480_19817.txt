 
although i know it was all a staged " mockumentary " , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . 
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . 
this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . 
i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera .
