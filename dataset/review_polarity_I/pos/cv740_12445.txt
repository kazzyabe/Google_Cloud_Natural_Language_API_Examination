a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' . 
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . 
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here . 
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . there were some i have to say . 
but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . i 
certainly hope so .
