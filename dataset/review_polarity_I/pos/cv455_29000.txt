 
 ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . ) 
such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does . 
i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well .
