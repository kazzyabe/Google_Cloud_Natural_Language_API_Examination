i'm an avid fan of the " alien " saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . 
in short , i had a good time . 
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . 
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) . 
and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : " who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! " 
johner : " well , i can get you off .
