 
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . 
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . 
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . " -it's 
like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
overdone . 
incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . 
it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one .
