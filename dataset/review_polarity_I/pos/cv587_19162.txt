 
for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . 
when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . 
this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library .
