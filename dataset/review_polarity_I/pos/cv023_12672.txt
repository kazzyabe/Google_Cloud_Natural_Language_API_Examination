when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? 
there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? 
oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? 
i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics .
