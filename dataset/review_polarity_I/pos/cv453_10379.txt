 
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . 
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . 
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . 
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . 
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .
