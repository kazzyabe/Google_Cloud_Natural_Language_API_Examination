i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't . 
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . 
as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember .
