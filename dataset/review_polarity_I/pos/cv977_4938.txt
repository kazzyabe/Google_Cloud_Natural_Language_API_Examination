 
however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . 
one thing : what's with the title ? 
not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . 
the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good . 
his female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . 
i liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating .
