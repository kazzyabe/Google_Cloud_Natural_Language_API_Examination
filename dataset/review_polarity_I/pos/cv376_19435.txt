 
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 
but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .
