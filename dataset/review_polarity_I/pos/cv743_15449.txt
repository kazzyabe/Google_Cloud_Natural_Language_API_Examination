 
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . 
in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . 
in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . 
in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it .
