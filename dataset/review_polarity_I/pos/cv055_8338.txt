 
this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . 
not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . 
in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . 
to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . 
secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . 
and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is .
