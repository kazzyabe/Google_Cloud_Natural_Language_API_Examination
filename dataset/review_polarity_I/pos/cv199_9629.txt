this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic . 
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . 
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . 
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . it's 
not a bad as i am making it out to be . 
it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . 
with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video .
