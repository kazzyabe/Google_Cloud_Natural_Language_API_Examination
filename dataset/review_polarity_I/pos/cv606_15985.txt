 
 ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . 
the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . 
despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . 
rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .
