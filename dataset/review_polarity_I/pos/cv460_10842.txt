 
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times . 
hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . ) 
after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home . 
i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . ) 
suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went " ewwww " about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing .
