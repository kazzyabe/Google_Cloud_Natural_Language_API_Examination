i swear i have seen the edge before . 
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . 
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . " 
despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . 
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . 
alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . 
he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable .
