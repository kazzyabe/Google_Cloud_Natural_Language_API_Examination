 
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . 
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .
