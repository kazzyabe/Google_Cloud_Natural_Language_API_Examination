 
there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before . 
the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job . 
patrick renna , who played gugino's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him .
