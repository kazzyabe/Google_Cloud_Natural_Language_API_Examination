those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . 
i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . 
going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . 
walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . 
augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . 
rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . 
i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . 
each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be .
