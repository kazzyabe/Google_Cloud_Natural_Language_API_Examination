 
from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . 
from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece . 
after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening .
