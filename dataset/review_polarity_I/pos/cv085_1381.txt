 
and i liked each film separately for which it was . 
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . 
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . 
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .
