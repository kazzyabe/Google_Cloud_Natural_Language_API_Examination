 
j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ? 
i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . 
but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . 
instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . 
until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr
