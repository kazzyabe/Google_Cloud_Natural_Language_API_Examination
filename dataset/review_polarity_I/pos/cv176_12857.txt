a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . 
the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . 
if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out .
