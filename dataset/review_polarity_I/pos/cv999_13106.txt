 
although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . 
carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . 
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . 
in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . 
nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be .
