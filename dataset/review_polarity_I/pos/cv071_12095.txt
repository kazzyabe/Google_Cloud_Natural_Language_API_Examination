 
with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . 
pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . 
 " i have a gun , and everything . 
as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . 
i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . 
at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . 
and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .
