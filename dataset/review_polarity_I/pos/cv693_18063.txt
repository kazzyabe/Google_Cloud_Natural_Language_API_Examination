let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . 
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . 
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . 
as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film .
