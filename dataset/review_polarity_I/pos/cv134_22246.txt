 
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint . 
one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects . 
when he was timon in 1994's " the lion king " i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in " stuart little " he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . 
for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know " stuart little " and " toy story 2 " are by far the best family films this year .
