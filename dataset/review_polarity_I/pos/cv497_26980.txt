there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . 
it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that . 
i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . 
i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?
