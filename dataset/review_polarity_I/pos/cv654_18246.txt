 
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . 
in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . 
in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .
