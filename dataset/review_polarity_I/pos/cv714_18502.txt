star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review 
a review by jamey hughton stars ) 
starring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g 
with all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . 
yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . 
one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii .
