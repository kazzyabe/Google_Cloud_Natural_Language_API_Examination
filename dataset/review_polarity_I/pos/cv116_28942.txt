 
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . 
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . 
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . 
i feel i got my money's worth . 
joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .
