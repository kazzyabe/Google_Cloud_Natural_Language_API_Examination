i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie . 
i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching " the x-files " every sunday night . 
it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . 
and i love gillian anderson . 
this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . 
fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . 
what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . 
both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon .
