when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . 
every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . 
hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . 
when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) .
