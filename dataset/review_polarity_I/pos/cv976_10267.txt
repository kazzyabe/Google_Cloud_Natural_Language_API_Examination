robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . 
a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because " i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . " 
all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . 
upon my first viewing i left bawling .
