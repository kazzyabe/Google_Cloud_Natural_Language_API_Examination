 
these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb . 
well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will .
