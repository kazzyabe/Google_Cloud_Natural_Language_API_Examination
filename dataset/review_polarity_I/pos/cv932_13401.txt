 
but i loved every freaking minute of it . 
hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . 
the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . 
then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . 
as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . 
and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it .
