 
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . 
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . 
i can say however i liked this movie . 
one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . 
instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .
