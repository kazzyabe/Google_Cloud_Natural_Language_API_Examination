 
comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . 
a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . 
one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . 
if you're prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation .
