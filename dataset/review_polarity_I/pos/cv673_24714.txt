 
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . 
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . 
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date . 
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it " all " . 
this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . 
yes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . 
it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .
