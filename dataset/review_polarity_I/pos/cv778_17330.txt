i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture . 
and i think that " 12 angry men " , " witness for the prosecution " and " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . 
but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents .
