 
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . 
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . 
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . 
but due to it's story , i doubt it will . 
it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did . 
the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . 
just thought i should let you know .
