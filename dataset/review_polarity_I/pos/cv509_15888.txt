as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . 
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . 
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is . 
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay . 
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . 
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious . 
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) . 
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky . 
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know . 
all i know is that i just like them both . 
he is , i believe , america's greatest actor . 
the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow . 
i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . 
e-mail ? 
when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using . 
and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .
