 
well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . 
but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . 
a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . 
this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . 
maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy .
