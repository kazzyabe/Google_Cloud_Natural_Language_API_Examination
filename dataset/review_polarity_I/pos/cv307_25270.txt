 
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends . 
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase " well , to make a long story short " i have the follow up phrase " too late " ready to go . ) 
now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well . 
i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish .
