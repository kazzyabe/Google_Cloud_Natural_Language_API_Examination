 
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . 
i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed . 
in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing . 
there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . 
my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . 
what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced .
