 
running time : 130 minutes 
being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma' . 
probably the best characters in movies that i like . 
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' .
