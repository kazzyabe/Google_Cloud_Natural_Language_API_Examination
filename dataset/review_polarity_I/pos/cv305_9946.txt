of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many " laugh-out-loud " moments . 
i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . 
and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . 
thankfully , just as your about to say " ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom " , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . 
like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .
