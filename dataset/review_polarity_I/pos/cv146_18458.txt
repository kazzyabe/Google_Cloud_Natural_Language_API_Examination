as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . 
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . 
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . 
well you know what i mean ) . 
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . 
but i digress . 
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . 
there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .
