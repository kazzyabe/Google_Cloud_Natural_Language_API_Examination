 
like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " . 
by scare , i don't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ? 
the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .
