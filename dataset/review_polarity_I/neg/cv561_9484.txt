 
who cares if heston dies ? 
who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? 
who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? " 
who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? 
and who cares about that whole plane spiel ? 
if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? " 
is . 
i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome .
