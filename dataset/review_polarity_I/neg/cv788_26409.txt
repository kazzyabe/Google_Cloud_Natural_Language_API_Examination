 
there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s . 
there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . 
i can't say either for " the way of the gun , " because it has very little going for it and i can't imagine anyone intelligently defending it .
