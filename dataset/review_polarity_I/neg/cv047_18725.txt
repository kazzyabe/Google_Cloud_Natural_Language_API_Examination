 theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . 
this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . 
i love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with .
