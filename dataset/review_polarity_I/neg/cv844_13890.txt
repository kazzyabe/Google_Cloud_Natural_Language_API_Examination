 
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . 
i can remember liking " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 . 
and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) . 
but , i digress .
