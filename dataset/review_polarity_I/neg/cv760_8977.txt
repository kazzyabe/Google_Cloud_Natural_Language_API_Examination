 
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot . 
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films . 
trust me , i looked hard to find some . 
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . 
i wanted to like this film more than i did . 
well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .
