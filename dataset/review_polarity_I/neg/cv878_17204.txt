 
one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . 
he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . 
the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .
