 
after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . 
after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation . 
my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . " 
jackson's response is , " i think i felt that way once . " 
you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk .
