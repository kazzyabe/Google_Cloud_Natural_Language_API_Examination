watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . 
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . 
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . 
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . 
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . 
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . 
but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .
