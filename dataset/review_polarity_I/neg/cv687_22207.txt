 
although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . 
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . 
including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . 
as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects .
