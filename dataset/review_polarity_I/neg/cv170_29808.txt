 
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . 
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . 
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . 
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . 
in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .
