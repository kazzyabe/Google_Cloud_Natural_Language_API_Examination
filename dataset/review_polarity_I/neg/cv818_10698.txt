ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . 
the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . 
as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves .
