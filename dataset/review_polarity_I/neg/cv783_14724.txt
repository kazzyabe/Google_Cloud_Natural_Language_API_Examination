 
not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . 
the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . 
as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . 
if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . 
lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable .
