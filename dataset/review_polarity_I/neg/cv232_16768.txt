 
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author . 
so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits .
