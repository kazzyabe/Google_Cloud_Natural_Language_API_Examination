synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas . 
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series " party of five . " 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube . 
 " party of five , " i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre . 
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line . 
unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny . 
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for . 
oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive ! 
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .
