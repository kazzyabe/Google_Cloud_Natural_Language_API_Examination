let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . 
i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . 
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin . 
yes , i do . 
last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . 
and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .
