ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . 
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . 
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . 
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it . 
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .
