 
finally , i forgot about it . 
the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , " american perfekt " . 
having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release . 
and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort .
