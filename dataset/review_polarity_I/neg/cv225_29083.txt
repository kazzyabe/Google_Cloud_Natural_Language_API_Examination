 what the shite were they thinking ? 
okay , so where do i start ? 
first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal . 
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . 
so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? 
well , it's actually pretty simple . 
oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue .
