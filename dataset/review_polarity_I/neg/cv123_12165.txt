 
peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! " 
at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . 
what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .
