anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless . 
the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( " father , have i offended you in some way ? 
why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . 
i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched .
