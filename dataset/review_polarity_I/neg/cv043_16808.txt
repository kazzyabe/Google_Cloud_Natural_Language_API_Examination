 
it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . 
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . 
constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything .
