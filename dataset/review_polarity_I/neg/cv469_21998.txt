 
every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool . 
it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) . 
after enduring " end of days , " all i can say is " get thee behind me , satan .
