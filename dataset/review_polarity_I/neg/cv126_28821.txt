 now 
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . well , 
what can i say . i 
just don't have the words . i 
could go on . 
but i won't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci's antics from time to time ( ironic , eh . what 
about the leads , dammit ! ) and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course ) . 
btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then .
