it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . 
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . 
if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . 
if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes .
