 
julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . 
the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . 
but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . 
did he get 'hooked' ? 
well , let's just say that if he didn't , i would give this film a grade of " d " .
