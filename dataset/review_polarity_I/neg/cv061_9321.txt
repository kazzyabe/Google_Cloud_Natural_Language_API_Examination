 
because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone . 
i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , " what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? " 
and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer . 
oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . 
and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun .
