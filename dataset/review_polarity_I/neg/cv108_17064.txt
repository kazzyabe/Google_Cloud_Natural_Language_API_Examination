 
after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . 
i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the " batman " series with " batman forever " and " batman and robin .
