 
that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . 
i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad . 
it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . 
i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . 
there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so " good " at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . 
i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off .
