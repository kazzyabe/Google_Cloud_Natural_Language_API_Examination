 
i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed . 
i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it .
