 
with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . 
i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . 
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end .
