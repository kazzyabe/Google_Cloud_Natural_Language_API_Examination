where do i begin ? 
okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . 
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . 
so i stayed . 
of course , i recommend the same for everyone . 
but i do admit it . 
of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don't recommend it . 
but guess what ? 
alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away .
