 
using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . 
both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . 
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . 
the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school . 
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i .
