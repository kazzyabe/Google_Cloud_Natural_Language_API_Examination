 
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . 
i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , " let's do it again , but this time , i want more . 
a far cry from his days as linc in " the mod squad " , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction .
