i should have known , damn it , i should have known . 
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . 
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . 
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund . 
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . 
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose . 
when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . 
and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . 
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . 
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .
