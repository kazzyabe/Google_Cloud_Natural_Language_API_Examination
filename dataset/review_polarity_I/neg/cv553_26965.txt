 
several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . 
and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . 
no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . 
here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask .
