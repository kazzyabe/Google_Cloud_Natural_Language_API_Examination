in my review of " the spy who shagged me , " i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . 
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying " the blair witch project " 's web strategy . 
while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters .
