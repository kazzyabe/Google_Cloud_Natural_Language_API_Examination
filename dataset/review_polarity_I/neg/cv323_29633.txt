 
and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well . 
ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? 
i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke . 
and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions . i 
appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . 
either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it .
