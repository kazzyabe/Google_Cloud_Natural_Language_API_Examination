 
so i didn't expect too much from this . 
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . 
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . 
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
i believe hichock once said that " it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one " . 
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " .
