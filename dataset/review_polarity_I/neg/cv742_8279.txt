when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . 
masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . 
i remember loving it when i was eleven . 
but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder .
