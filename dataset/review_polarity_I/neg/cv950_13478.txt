 
after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . 
the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . 
we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? 
but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities .
