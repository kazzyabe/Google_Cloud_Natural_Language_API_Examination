 
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . 
i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . 
kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . 
that's the trouble with me , * i * notice . 
or sean connery , but not arnold " i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life " schwarzenegger . 
my interest to see it is low , but i hope it's better than this .
