 
then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . 
i could go on longer , but i don't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .
