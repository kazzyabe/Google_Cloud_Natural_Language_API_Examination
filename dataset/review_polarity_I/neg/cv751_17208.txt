 
what is the point of this ? 
i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far . 
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . 
after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . 
the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . 
if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home .
