 
at least , i * think * that's what they do . 
i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't . 
the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . 
but " virus " , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster . 
for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! 
now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it .
