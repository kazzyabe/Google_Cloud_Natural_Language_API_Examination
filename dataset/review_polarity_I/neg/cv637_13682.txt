i'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool , humming " i will always love you " and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success . 
it isn't necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in " kevin ! " 
for at least a few more years . 
 ( i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles : post encounters of the worst kind ; farewell , my salary ; howard the postman ; the postman's never watched twice . ) 
why , oh why , do i have so many questions ? 
 ( i could ask plenty more . ) 
shouldn't a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything ? 
you have one great line in this film , and you deliver it to a mule ! : 
 " the things i like about my ass . 
actually , i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes , a relaxed cynicism , if you'll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldn't resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country .
