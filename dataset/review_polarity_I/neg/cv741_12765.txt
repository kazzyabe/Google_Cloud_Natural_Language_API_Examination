several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . 
i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together .
