 
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . 
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . 
for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . 
lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . 
for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 .
