 
why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending . 
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . 
i miss originality in film , i really do . 
what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia . 
as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . 
after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? 
really , i don't care . 
i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can .
