 
i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen " get carter " i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie . 
 * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .
