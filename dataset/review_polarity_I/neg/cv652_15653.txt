 
since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , " what happens after you die ? " 
or , " how does it feel to be a snowman ? " 
but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . 
since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . 
 " no , i da snowman , " replies jack .
