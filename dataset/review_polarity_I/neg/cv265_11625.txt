 
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short . 
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . 
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . 
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called " wisdom " with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . 
what i like to call " guess what , it was all a dream " scenario . 
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . 
as i recall , " wisdom " was a decent film .
