 
one girl said if i'd seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it . 
almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . 
so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . 
what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . 
in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it .
