 
his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . 
it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . 
as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . 
there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . 
the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? 
isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ? 
the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero .
