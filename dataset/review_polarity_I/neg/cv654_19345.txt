 
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . 
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . 
now , when i say it took forever to set up the " relationship " between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . 
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . 
oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? 
yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . 
this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .
