 
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . 
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . 
 ( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . " 
reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . 
and i think you know what those two things are .
