 connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . 
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . 
instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . 
michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . 
oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . 
incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .
