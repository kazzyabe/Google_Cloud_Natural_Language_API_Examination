 
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . 
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . 
when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ? 
were they even attracted to each other ? " 
if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . 
the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .
