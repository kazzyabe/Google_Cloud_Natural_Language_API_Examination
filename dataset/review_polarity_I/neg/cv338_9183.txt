 
one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . 
as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . 
an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , " well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . 
however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .
