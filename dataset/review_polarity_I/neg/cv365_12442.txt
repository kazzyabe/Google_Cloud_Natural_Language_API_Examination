 
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu . i said frown . 
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was . i 
don't think i've ever seen a cg model look so real before . in this movie it felt more like - " well people , we're gonna run into that there island in a few hours - i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i can't turn off the engines . i'm 
passing the cafeteria on the way , can i get anybody anything ? " 
the ending of this movie really is terrible . i 
almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris .
