what a contrast ! 
in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . 
i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . 
i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .
