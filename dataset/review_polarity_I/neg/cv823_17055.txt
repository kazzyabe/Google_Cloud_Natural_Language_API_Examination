starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . 
she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . 
if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original .
