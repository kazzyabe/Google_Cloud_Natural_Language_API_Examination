 
i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . 
why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work .
