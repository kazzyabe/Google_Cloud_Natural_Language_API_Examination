this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie . 
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . 
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . " 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun . 
i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . 
it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself .
