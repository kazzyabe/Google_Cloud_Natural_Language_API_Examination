 
i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . 
most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats ! " 
some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept . 
still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is " so bad it's good , " you could do worse than bats . 
i'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .
