sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . 
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting . 
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . 
it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered . 
marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .
