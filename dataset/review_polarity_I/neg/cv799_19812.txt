 
i could just discount them and say , " well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . " 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water . 
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . 
 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . 
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise . 
well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . 
and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves " what was i thinking ? ? " . 
if it works for them then that's okay i guess .
