 " 
ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas . 
write a line for the one of prisoners like " i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad . 
how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling " shotgun " about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think . 
he's dirty and potty-mouthed , he's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them . 
if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .
