 
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked " under siege " ) . 
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't . 
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . 
 " executive decision " ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . 
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it . 
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la " mystery science theatre 3000 , " and this was a couple years before i had heard of " mystery science theatre 3000 . 
he even goes as far as to say , " i don't want to kill someone , " and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . 
he does it well , i guess , but this is no " alfie . 
i mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . 
but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one .
