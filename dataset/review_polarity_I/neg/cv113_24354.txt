 
now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . 
ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster's millions ? " . 
as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says " what is this , brewster's millions ? " 
it was quite surreal . 
up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good .
