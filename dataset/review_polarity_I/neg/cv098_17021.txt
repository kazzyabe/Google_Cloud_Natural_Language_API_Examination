 
well , i didn't , at least . 
one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza . 
i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . 
like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline .
