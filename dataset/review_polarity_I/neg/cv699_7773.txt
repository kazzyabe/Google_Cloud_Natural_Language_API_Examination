okay , i just don't know why , but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . 
i couldn't even make it through " the santa clause , " so why did i even see this ? 
 ( just to make an idle point , i did like " toy story , " but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films . 
well , this is my excuse : it was prom night , i'm not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing " grosse pointe blank " - wouldn't mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first . 
in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn't dreamed by an american . 
but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement . 
let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . 
he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . 
the whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this . 
big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they're just going to do it the exact same way ? 
huh ? 
my ( for some of the actors' names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . okay , 
so i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star )
