 
this is not a movie that i can easily review . 
and i loved watching it . 
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying " if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death . 
the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) .
