 
personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . 
despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . 
at many points , i was even confused . 
there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .
