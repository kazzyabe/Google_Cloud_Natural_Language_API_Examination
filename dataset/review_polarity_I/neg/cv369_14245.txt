 
it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . 
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : " i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! " 
and " entrepreneurship , babycakes ! " 
standing out among my favorites .
