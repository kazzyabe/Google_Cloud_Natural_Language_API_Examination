 
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . 
for your amusement , i will explain the plot . 
other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . 
then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . 
instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling .
