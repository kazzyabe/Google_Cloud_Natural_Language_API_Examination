 
first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . 
fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . 
schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad .
