 
the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . 
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .
