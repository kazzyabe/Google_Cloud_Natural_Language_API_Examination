 
of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . 
playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . 
she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for " aliens , " but she's just awesome . 
overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . 
the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . 
but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the " alien " series .
