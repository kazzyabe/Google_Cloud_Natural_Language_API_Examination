 
i'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . 
disney tentatively plans a theater release of " monoko hime " shortly following the summer '97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . 
i'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . 
although the wait is unfortunate , it's good to know that it's being released at all , for " kiki's delivery service " is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . 
watch this movie . 
along with " man bites dog , " and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen .
