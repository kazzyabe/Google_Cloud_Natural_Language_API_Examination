for the blood loving moviegoer , " destination " contains buckets of blood , guts , and all that good stuff . 
 " final destination " is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans , and a sleeper hit at the box office . 
hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me . 
by scare , i don't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ? 
the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .
