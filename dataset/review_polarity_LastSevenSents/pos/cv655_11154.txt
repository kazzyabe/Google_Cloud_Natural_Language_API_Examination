 
 " les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . 
anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . 
note : " les vacances de m . hulot " was not rated by the mpaa . 
it would at most receive a pg rating .
