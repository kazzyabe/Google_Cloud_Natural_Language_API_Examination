 
but then , when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori , the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus . 
nicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from . 
penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast , too . 
only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot . 
penn's direction is astounding , each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water , perhaps , or of sanity . 
it all builds up to a shattering , devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up .
