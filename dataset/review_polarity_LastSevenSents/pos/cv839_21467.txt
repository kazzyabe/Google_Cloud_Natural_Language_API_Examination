 
the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . 
 ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) 
three to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . 
three to tango is a gem . 
the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . 
one of the better romantic comedies of 1999 .
