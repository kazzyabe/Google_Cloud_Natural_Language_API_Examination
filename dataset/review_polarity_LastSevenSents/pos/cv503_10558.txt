 
the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . 
sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable . 
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . 
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . 
while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of " to die for , " the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this " best picture " deal ? ) . 
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .
