 
that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning . 
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . 
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . 
the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . 
so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? 
he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . 
perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .
