 
devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , " idle hands , " gives a frantic and convincing lead performance . 
kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane . 
smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence .

tony todd's one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief . 
bottom line : watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting .
