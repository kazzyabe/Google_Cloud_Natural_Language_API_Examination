 
it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . 
a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . 
take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . 
proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .
