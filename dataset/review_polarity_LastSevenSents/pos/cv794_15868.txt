 
although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , " the faculty " is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . 
while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . 
and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . 
+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . 
in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . 
if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving .
