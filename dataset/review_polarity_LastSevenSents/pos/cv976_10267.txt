 
the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . 
martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . 
that is what a river runs through it does . 
it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . 
both times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . 
but the dream is lovely .
