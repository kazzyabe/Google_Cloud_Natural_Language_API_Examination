 
drew barrymore who shone in ? ever after' is wonderful as ? josie , grossy' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter . 
it addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting . 
hard to believe , but possible . 
there may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss . 
so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it . 
either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending .
