 
had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . 
it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . 
i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . 
my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? " 
but enough carping . 
 " rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . 
see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .
