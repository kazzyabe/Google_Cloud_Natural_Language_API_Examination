 
unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . 
that's not to say the movie isn't funny . 
screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . 
herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style . 
let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . 
with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong .
