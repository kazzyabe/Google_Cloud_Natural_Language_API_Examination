 
all in all , " scream 3 " does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . 
as a trilogy , " scream " was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . 
almost sad to see it go . 
but then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and " scream 3 " does a fine job of providing closure to its characters . 
for now , " scream " holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid . 
not too shabby .
