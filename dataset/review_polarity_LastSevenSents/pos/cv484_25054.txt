 
but then trouble begins . 
there's a rogue wave , a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60 , 000 lb . 
of fish that could spoil . 
but that's minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas . 
it's formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome . 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the perfect storm " is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 . 
hang on for the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer !
