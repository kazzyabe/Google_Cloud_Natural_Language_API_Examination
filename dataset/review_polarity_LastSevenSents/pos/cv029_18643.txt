 
ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . 
with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . 
still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . 
there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . 
the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . 
`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .
