 
hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can . 
the adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 . 
it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages . 
jeffrey thinks the film is " great " and gives it * * * * . 
he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies . 
his favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) .
