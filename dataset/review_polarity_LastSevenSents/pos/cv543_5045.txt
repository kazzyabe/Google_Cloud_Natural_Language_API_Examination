 
gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing . 
getting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings . 
first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times . 
second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop . 
overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting . 
director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery .
