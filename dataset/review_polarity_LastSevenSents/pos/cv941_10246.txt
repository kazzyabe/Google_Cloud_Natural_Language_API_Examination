michelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies . 
her comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year .
