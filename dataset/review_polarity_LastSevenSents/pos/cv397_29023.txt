 leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives " rh2 " the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . 
production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . 
the rest of the techs are of the same high quality . 
i'm surprised to even say that " rush hour 2 " is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . 
it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . 
i give it a b .
