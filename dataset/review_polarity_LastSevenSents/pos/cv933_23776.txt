 
but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . 
this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . 
off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . 
whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . 
my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year . 
i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .
