 
james garner is the playboy just like in many other movies . 
i liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife . 
tony randall is funny as always . 
1962 was more than 35 years ago . 
how many accountants , copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work ? 
this is the white middle class , i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use . 
these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves . 
perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ?
