 
jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity . 
in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . 
unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . 
in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it . 
so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . 
why ? 
with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only " everyone says i love you " was able to make my heart sing .
