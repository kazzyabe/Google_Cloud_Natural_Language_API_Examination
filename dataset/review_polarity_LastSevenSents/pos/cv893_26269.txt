 
there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . 
this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . 
in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . 
he's lost his voice . 
does that little itty bitty detail matter ? 
maybe not to most , but it sure made my night . 
and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .
