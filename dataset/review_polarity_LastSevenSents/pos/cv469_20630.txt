 
produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film " dracula " . 
in comparison , i can say that " dracula " has visuals that even " frankenstein " can not live up to . 
but when it comes to story , characters and casting , " frankenstein " is stronger . 
but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's " interview with the vampire " . 
although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . 
branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .
