 
les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . 
my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . 
each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . 
for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . 
it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . 
however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked .
