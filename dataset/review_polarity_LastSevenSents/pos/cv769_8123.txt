 
screenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros . 
and the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story . 
all ages will enjoy men in black . 
it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again . 
although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . 
the ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done . 
a sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to !
