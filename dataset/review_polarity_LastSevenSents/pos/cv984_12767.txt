 
josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , " book this clown ! " 
and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . 
any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . 
in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . 
while the eschewing of " ferocious pairing " is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the " preferred " dynamics of social group interaction . 
more mature than stillman's previous two films , " the last days of disco " is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . 
it's a movie you should definitely get on down to .
