 
my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . 
the film is predicable , but who cares ? 
the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . 
in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . 
in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . 
i just want everyone to know that i laughed . 
a lot .
