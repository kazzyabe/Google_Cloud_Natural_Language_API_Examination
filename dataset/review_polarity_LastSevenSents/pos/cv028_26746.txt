 
it's simply different . 
in fact , if you haven't seen " the blair witch project " , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films . 
the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . 
but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . 
to me the story of " the blair witch project " seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that " the book of shadows " is certainly assured . 
and it's already time to look forward to " blair witch 3 " .
