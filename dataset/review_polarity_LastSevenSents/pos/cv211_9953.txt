 
aliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . 
aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . 
aliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . 
cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . 
technically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . 
aside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while .
