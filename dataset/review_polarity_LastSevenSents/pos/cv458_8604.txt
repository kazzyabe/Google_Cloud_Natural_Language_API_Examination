 
to go beyond good and evil . 
this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . 
because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . 
but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . 
there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . 
this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society .
