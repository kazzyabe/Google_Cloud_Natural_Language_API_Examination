 
there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . 
however , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . 
if you haven't seen the movie , rent it . 
watch it . 
then rewind the tape , and watch it again . 
trust me , you'll be amazed .
