 
most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . 
there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . 
children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . 
it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . 
if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . 
instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .
