 
there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well .

although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise .
