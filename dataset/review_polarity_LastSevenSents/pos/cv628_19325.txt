 
pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head . 
cons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg . 
young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) . 
running time is a bit short . 
would you recommend this to friends ? 
not to my friends , but to the movie-going public i would .
