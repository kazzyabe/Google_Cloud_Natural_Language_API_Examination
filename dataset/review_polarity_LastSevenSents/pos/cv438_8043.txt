 
i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . 
there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . 
what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . 
 " seven " is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man . 
john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of " scum . " 
but as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice .
