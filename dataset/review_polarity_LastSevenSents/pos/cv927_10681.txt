an encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these .

it's likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping .
