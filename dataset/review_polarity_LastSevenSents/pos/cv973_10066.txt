 
rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy . 
the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . 
a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . 
additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : 
beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron . 
john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron . 
beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .
