 
if you've loved this guy as the " goofball " in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( " this is so awesome ! ! " ) , 
only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick . 
and speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? 
the arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level . 
once again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork . 
plot-wise , i too did wonder how the " bad guy " was able to track them so well , but it didn't really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) . 
but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance . 
a great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year . 
 " this is amazing ! ! ! "
