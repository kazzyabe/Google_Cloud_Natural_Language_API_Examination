 
pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's " ride of the valkyries " , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . 
for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . 
the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . 
as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . 
i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . 
then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .
