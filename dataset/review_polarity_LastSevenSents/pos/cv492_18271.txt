 
there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . 
combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . 
the film is not without its faults . 
some of the scenes and ideas are " borrowed " a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . 
some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke . 
however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .
