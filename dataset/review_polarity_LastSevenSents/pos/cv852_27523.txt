 
david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . 
after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i've got to do a remake of this film ! " 
but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : " okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . 
we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . 
and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . " 
yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . 
but at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .
