 
leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves . 
 ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . 
gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . 
 ( wanna guess who wins ? ) 
 " back to the minors " is a movie that has no reason to exist . 
there's hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .
