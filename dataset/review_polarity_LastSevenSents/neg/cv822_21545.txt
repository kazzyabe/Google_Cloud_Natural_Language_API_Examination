 
i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners . 
playing such characters does not help actors' careers . 
still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is " so bad it's good , " you could do worse than bats . 
it does have a tremendous amount of camp value . 
i'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it . 
more power to them .
