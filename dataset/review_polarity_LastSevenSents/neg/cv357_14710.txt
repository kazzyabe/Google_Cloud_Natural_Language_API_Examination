 
in this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again . 
a good joke , but a stolen one . 
another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself . 
movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit . 
woo won't be one either . 
so why was it made ? 
and more importantly , isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? 
everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point .
