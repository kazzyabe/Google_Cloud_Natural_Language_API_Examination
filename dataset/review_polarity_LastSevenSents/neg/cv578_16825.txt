 
halfway through , i still didn't have an answer . 
by the end credits , i just gave up and ran out . 
antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs . 
allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone can't act , even in a cartoon . 
this film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull . 
hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in .
