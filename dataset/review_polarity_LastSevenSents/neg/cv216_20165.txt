well , let's just call him the gas man . 
the production design is overblown , the special effects are overdone , and the script ( based on bob burden's " dark horse " comic book series ) is overbaked . 
the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar , but they can't begin to save " mystery men " --it's just one big mess . 
you're better off renting the video and pressing fast-forward to get to the funny bits . 
i believe i counted three .
