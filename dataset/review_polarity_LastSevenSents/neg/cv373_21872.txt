 
we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch . 
overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm 
yup those pretty much describe " end of days " .
