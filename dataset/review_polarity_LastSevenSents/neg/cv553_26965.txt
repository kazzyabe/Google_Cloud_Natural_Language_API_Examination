 
here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . 
jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . 
in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . 
if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over . 
rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . 
let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend .
