 
the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it . 
i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie . 
it wouldn't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better . 
but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending . 
thank god they didn't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked . 
god , there is no hope .
