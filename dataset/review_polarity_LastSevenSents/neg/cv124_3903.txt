 
at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . 
the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . 
in sum , this movie is beneath contempt . 
it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . 
if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . 
otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks .
