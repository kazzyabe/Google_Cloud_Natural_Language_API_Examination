 
so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . 
in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . 
although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . 
nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . 
the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . 
however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .
