 
chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven's ambassadors . 
another " best in show " alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington's cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv's " ally mcbeal , " " sweet november " ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband's lawyer . 
mark addy ( " the full monty " ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington's fake english butler . 
stealing the show in every scene she's in is wanda sykes ( " the chris rock show " ) as wellington's disgruntled maid . 
 " down to earth " is for chris rock fans only . 
all others should go rent " heaven can wait " or truly be brought down to earth .
