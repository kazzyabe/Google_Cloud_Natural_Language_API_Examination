 
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . 
the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . 
steven spielberg is picked on in particular . 
while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
the days of breathless are no more .
