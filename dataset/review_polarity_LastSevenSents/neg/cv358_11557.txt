the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) . 
columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? 
wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . 
thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . 
but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .
