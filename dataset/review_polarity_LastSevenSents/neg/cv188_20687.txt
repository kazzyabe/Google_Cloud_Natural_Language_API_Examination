 
i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . 
instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . 
or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . 
anything to avoid this painful movie . 
the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . 
sequel ? 
please have mercy .
