 
unfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase's career look like oscar material . 
the film , based on michael crichton's best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow . 
at the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions . 
questions like " why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? " , 
 " why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? " 
and finally , " will the manager give me a refund ? " 
90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors " come with me , there is a woman who can help . " 
unfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film . 
the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of " springtime for hitler . "
