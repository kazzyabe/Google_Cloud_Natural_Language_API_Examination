 
there's a moment when phil utters the line , " insert laugh here " , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience . 
the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way . 
instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way . 
the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting . 
instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films . 
you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .
