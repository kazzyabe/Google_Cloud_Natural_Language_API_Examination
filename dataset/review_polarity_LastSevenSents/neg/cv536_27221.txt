goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . 
heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . 
 ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . ) 
not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't . 
that is her hallmark .
