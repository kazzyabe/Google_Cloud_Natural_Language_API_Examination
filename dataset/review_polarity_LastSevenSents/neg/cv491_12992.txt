 
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one . 
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care . 
so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley . 
the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) . 
i just couldn't stop laughing .
