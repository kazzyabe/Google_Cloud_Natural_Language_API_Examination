 
do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him ? 
you would think so , wouldn't you . 
 " american perfekt " is a waste of time . 
nothing is gained from watching this movie , except maybe a migraine . 
and if you do rent it , don't bother trying to figure out what's going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end . 
this doesn't happen . 
and no explanation is given for the misspelling of " perfect " , either .
