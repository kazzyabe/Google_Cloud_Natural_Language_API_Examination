 
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . 
some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . 
the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two . 
outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . 
if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't . 
make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery .
