 
many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . 
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . 
nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? 
i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . 
ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . 
one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . 
i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? " 
we know jon , it's called editing .
