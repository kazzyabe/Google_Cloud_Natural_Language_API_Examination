 
contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . 
lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . 
then again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . 
what an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . 
the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . 
well , danger potential movie goers ! 
danger ! 
this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity .
