 
notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . 
first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . 
his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .

the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . 
some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn't particularly want to stay .
