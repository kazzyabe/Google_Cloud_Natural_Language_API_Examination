 
then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . 
 " supernova " is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . 
that's it . 
if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . 
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . 
honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? 
it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what " supernova " is .
