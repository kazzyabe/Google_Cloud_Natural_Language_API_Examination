 
references to deloreans , madonna , " dallas " , ivana and donald , burt and loni and " miami vice " get old fast . 
the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn't much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions . 
they're not funny and it doesn't work . 
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don't you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . 
maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino . 
 ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be . )
