 
why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ? 
in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz's murder . 
as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it . 
i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it . 
jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 . 
it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex . 
i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .
