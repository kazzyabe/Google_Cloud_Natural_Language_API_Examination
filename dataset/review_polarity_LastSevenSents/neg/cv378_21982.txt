 
so why continue to watch ? 
this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . 
 " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! " 
 " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass . 
what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . 
terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . 
 " i'm unpredictable ! " 
an overexcited ben stiller shouts out . 
no ben , you're the complete opposite .
