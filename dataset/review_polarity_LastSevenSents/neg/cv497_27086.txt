 
but kelly's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys . 
this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice . 
jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . 
the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . 
under richardson's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry . 
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .
