barker . 
unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , 
we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project . 
the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie . 
the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra . 
this is definitely one to avoid , folks . 
the real mccoy is anything but !
