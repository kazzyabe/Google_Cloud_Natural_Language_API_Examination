 
spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , " wannabe . " 
the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . 
this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . 
spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . 
but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . 
once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .
