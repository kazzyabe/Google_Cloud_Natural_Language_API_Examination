 
the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . 
he gave them heart . 
cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . 
he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . 
this is not the way to get any message across . 
why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ? 
cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .
