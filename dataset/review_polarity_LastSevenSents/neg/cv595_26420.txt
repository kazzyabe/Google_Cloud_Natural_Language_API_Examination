 
carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not . 
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original . 
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) . 
in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results . 
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible . 
 * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .
