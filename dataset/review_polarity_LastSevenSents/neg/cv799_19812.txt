 
if it works for them then that's okay i guess . 
i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the " nothing is more " approach . 
pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . 
for 90 minutes . 
and we'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , " my god , wouldn't it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! 
this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! " . 
or , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . 
 " man , do you know how scary it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! 
now this is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! "
