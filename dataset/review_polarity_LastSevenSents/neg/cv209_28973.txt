 
kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful . 
i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . 
i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . 
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . 
the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . 
no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .
