 
the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . 
even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two " scream " s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . 
i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! " 
cliffhanger , he said " who is this time , the grandma ? " 
all in all , " i still know " tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . 
i mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . .
