 
one of the oldest maxims of film-going is " beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . " 
 " neil simon's the odd couple ii " is no exception to the rule . 
while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . 
of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my " young-whippersnapper " ass to boot . 
one thing's for sure , though . 
they'll never catch me in a car chase .
