 
at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . 
it's all handwaving . 
the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . 
it's not easy to make a movie about something . 
the other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . 
a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time .
