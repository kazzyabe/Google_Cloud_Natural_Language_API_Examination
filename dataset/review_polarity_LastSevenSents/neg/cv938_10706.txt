 
lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . 
adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . 
i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . 
don't fear the rush . 
fear the movie . 
watch something else .
