 
adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . 
it's stone that is a disappointment among the actors . 
how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? 
costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . 
even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . 
on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . 
that is if you can put up with stone's cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies .
