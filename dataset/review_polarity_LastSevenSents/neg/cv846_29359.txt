 
like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . 
certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . 
they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . 
it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . 
the film does not offer much to an adult audience . 
i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
