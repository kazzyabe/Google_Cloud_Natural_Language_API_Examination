 
i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . 
mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . 
but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . 
she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . 
this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . 
this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .
