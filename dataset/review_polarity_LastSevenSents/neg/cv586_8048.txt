 
 " batman & robin " is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the " worst film of the year " by the time 1998 rolls along . 
note to warner bros . -- if you're going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone . 
because it could actually get worse than this . 
what schumacher does not understand is that " comic book " doesn't automatically equal unbearable idiocy . 
the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .
