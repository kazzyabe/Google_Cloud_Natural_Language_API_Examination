 
alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients . 
this appears to be a high profile and well-paid job . 
we are supposed to care about alessa's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father . 
alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint . 
this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero . 
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
