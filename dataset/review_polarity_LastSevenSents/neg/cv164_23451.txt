 
there is no contrast to any of the characters . 
by having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . 
ostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona's loving manner with everyone on town . 
even that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . 
it's been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . 
what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it's ineptitude .
