 
apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . 
the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . 
although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . 
it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com 
 ) is better than the film .
