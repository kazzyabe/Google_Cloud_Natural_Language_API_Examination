 
very impressive trick ! 
the one ( half ? ) 
plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . 
the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . 
however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . 
in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . 
i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . 
oh well , win some , lose some .
