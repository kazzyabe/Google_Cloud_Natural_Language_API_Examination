 ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans , " i . e . 
 " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . ) 
let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . 
let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ) .
