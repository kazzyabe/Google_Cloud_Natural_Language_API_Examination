what's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california .

and now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .
