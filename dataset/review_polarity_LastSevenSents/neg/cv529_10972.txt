 
its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent . 
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . 
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . 
if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . 
depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . 
who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? 
but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all .
