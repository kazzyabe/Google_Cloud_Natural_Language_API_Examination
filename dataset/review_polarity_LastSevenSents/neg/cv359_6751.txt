 
and it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . 
but who cares ? 
it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . 
oh , and there were plenty of explosions in " metro , " as well . 
how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . 
if there is one major objection i had to " metro " , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . 
 " metro " is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end .
