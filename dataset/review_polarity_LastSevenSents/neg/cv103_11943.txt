 
it's icky . 
it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . 
my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . 
more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . 
instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . 
and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .
