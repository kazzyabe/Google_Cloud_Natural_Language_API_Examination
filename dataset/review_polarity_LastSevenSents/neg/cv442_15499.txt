 
but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script . 
them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story . 
let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says " that'll do , pig . 
that'll do . " 
that's it . 
hope i didn't ruin it for you . 
but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ?
