 
mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . 
the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . 
the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . 
the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . 
he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . 
if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film .
