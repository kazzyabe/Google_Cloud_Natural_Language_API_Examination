 
sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . 
snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . 
dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . 
when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . 
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . 
the " 1600 " in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . 
serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !
