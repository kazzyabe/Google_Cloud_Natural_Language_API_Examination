 
that should count for something . 
way back in the aftermath " the exorcist " and " the omen , " supernatural swill like " end of days " might have passed muster as a b-movie . 
but that was then and this is now . 
 " the x-files " and " buffy the vampire slayer " deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on " the 700 club " and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw . 
after enduring " end of days , " all i can say is " get thee behind me , satan . 
and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well . "
