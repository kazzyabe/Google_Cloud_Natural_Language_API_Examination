 
this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . 
the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . 
perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . 
pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven " satire " of excess and ego . 
it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . 
otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .
