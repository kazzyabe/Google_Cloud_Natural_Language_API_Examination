 
people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen . 
had to have something to do . 
dumb , dumb , dumb movie . 
i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . 
it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself . 
lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute " horror , " in my opinion .
