 " the plot stops here " 
i didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i've ever seen . 
at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) . 
it was like they stole for every other movie down to a " t " . 
the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . 
don't even bother !
