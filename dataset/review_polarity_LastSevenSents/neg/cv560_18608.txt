 
there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . 
either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . 
yes , men at work . 
yowza ! 
the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . 
there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . 
thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .
