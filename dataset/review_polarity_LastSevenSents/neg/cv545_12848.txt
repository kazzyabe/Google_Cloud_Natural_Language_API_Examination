 
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . 
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . 
she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . 
but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . 
maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . 
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing .
