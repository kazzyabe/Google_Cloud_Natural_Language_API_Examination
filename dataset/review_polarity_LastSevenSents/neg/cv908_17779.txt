 
and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . 
in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . 
never been kissed is a mediocre film at best . 
the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . 
the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . 
unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .
