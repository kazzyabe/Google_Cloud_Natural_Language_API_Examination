 
with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . 
 " pokemon 3 : the movie " has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . 
for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow .
