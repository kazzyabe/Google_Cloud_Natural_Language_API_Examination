 
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . 
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . 
so what was the point of the wig and the car ? 
 " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch's " wild at heart , " but if so joff ? must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie . 
it's hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . " 
it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . 
it should have stayed there .
