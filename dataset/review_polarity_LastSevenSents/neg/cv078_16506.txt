 
in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . 
although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . 
donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous . 
the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . 
basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . 
it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? 
as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .
