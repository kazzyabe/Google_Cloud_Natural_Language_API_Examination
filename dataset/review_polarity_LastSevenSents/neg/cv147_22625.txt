 
 " know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? 
so run , that ye may obtain . " 
1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv] 
achieving anything worthy in life requires " playing it to the bone " . 
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives . 
this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . 
as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time . 
but as a principle of life , the phrase " play it to the bone " are words to live by .
