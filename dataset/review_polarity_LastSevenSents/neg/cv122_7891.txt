 
they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks . 
none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap . 
but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) . 
i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . " 
i seem to respect directors if they aren't " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes . 
 " the man from hollywood " is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously .
