 
there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . 
i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . 
the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . 
its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . 
big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . 
it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .
