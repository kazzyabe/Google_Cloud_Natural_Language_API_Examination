 
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . 
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past . 
moresco needs to either trust his audience's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . 
his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . 
if he actually gets that chance .
