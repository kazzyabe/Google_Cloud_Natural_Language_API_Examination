 
sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . 
suspense at its very derivative ! 
as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible . 
comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much . 
maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . 
early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . 
allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker .
