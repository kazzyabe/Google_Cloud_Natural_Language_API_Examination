 
as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship . 
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . 
judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . 
the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson . 
i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! " 
without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .
