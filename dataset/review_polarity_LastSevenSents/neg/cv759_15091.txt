 
there are arguably logical flaws in the film . 
there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . 
it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . 
i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . 
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
perhaps i will read the book .
