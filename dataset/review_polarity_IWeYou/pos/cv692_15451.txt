 
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative . 
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . 
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here . 
it is a world that you want to walk around in . 
 " babe : pig in the city " should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . 
it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . 
please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between " babe : pig in the city " being a very good film and the original being a great one . 
as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .
