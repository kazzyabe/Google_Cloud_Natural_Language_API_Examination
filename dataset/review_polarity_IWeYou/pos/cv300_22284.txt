 
they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . 
as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . 
greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . 
if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . 
fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . 
if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .
