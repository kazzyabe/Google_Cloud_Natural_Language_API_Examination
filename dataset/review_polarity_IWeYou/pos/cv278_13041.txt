 
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . 
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask . 
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . 
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . 
as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . 
and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . 
but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . 
that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . 
and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .
