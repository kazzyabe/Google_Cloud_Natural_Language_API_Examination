 
but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie . 
it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while . 
and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify . 
but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should . 
it's not the film for you . 
it's the film for you and your family . 
the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick . 
all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch .
