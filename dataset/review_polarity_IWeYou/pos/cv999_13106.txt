 
combine all these names and concepts into " truman burbank , " and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . 
although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . 
carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . 
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . 
one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . 
in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . 
nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be .
