 
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . 
when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last . 
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . 
the one i still listen to the most is " tantric songs " , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken .
