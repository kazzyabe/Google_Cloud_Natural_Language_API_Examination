 
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . 
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on . 
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . 
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche . 
i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . 
while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there . 
the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . 
thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . 
that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . 
i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . 
that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not . 
i can't say i totally enjoyed " love is the devil , " though . 
despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through . 
as such , i respect the way the film looks . 
then i would have had something to hold me over even now .
