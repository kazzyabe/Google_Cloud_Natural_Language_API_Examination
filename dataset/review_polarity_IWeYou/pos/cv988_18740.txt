i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't . 
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . 
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . 
in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . 
for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . 
i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . 
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . 
as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember .
