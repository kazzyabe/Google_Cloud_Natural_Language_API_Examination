 
i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie . 
having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . 
fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . 
and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . 
spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . 
through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . 
however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .
