 
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . 
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . 
longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] 
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . 
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . 
you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . 
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . 
but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . 
if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . 
another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . 
 ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . 
so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story .
