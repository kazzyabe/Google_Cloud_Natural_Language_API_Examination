in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . 
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . 
jennifer love hewitt's song , " how do i deal " is also played for about thirty seconds . 
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . 
the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film .
