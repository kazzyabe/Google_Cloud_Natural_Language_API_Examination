 
in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . 
so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . 
while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . 
to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't " do much " for me .
