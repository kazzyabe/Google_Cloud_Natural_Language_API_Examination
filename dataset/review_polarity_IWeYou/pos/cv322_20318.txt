 the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . 
this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . 
renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) .
