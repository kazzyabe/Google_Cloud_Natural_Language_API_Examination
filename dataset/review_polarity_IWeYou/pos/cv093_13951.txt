 
and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . 
so why did i enjoy it so much ? 
for one thing , the cast is great . 
by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . 
during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . 
of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . 
don't let the premise prevent you from watching it . 
it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .
