are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? 
director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film " next stop wonderland " . 
later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away . 
the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet . 
the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over . 
when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze . 
the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance .
