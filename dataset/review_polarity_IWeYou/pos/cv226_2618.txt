 
on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . 
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . 
however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . 
since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey .
