i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . 
that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible . 
on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . 
the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . 
it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me . 
however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would " the thin red line " above " ryan ) .
