three things i learned from " being john malkovich " : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there . 
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . 
 " i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , " he explains in the press notes , " blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . 
it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start . 
craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) . 
by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface . 
at one point , craig says , " do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? " 
truer words were never spoken .
