 
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . 
on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide . 
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . 
in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . 
in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . 
particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .
