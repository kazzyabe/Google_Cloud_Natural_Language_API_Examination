 
maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam . 
as this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty . 
the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true . 
alas , i have one regret . 
and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film .
