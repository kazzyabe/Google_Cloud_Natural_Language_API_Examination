after watching " rat race " last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . 
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first .

had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . 
my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? " 
but enough carping .
