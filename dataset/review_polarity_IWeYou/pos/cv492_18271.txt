 
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . 
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . 
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . 
>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . 
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . 
i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really " utilized " keanu reeves ? 
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . 
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . 
combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen .
