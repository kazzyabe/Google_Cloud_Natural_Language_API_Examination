 
i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is . 
by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . 
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . 
hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . 
it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . 
we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below . 
for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?
