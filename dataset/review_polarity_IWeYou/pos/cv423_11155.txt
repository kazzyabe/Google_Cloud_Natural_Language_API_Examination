 
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . 
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . 
with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . 
we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways .
