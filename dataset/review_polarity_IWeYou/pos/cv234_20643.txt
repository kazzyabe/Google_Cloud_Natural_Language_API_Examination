when i saw the trailer for " the sixth sense , " i didn't expect much from it . 
if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . " 
anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . 
one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , " i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun " ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . 
only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . 
bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .
