 
for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 
from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . 
if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of " seventeen " magazine . 
 ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . 
if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong . 
perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children .
