 
it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? 
the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner . 
every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing . 
as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .
