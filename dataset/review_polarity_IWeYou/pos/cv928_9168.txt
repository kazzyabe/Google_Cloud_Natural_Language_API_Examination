i swear i have seen the edge before . 
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . 
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . 
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . 
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . 
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character . 
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . 
as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . " 
despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . 
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . 
thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . 
alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . 
he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . 
it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear .
