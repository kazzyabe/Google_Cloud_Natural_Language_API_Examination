 
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . 
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . 
don't believe the previews that you see . 
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . 
but due to it's story , i doubt it will . 
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . 
certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . 
it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . 
but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . 
it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did . 
the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . 
by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( " what " becomes " wet " and you should understand ) . 
just thought i should let you know .
