 
it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you . 
can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? 
what do you think ? 
however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . 
as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . 
however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears .
