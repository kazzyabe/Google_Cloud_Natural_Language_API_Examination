 
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . 
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . 
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . 
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . 
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . 
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . 
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . 
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . 
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .
