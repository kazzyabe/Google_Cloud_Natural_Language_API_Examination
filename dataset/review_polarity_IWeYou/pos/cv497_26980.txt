there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . 
where as " fargo " was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , " lucky numbers " is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . 
it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that . 
i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . 
more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . 
it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good . 
i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?
