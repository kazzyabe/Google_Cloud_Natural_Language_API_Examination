mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . evil tells mini me , " you complete me , " in a loving manner . 
the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . 
there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing . 
the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 
it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . 
i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters .
