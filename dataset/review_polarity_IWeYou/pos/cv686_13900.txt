 
there was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film , as i knew exactly what was going to happen . 
because of this , i will tread lightly so i don't ruin it for anyone reading this review , and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it . 
if i'm being awfully vague about details , it's because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half . 
all i can say is go watch this film , because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together , through the good and the bad . 
and after you see the movie , you will understand why this review has been written the way it has .
