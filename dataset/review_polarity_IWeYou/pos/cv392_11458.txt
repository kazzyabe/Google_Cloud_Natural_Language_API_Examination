the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . 
just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . 
here you learn _two_ things . 
everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . 
oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .
