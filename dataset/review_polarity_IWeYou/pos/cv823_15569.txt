upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . 
there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . 
only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble . 
in the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter . 
as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .
