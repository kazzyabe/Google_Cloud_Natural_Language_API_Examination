 
before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid . 
in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . 
if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . 
otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through .
