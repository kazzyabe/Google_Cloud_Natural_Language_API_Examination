 
a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . 
when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . 
but believe me , don't take 'lake placid' too seriously or you won't like it . 
but i guess it rates above the 'popcorn' rating . 
sit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . 
even though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . 
'lake placid' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too .
