 
if not well you get the jurisdiction . 
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . 
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . 
i can say however i liked this movie . 
one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . 
even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . 
the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . 
instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . 
house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .
