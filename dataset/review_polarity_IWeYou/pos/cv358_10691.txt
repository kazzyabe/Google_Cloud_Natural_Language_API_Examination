 
we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . 
they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . 
and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . 
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . 
as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . 
this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . 
it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them . 
sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better .
