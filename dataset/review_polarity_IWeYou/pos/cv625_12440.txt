 
after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? 
the strength of this film is it's gritty realism . 
i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken . 
how could they have chosen between these three actors ? 
there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two . 
i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : )
