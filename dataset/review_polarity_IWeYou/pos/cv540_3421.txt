 
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . 
that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . 
heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor .
