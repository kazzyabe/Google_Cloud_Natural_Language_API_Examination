 
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . 
and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " 
you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . 
even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . 
the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .
