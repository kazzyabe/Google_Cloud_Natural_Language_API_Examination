 
no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . 
this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . 
in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does . 
no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . 
speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by .
