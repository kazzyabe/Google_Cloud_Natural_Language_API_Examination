 
for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . 
for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . 
seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . 
braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . 
patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . 
however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor . 
when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film .
