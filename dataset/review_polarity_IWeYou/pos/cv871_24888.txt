 
difficult should be a walk in the park for you . 
although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . 
even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .
