let's say you live at the end of an airport runway . 
now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth . 
wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? 
of course you would . 
it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film . 
one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . 
and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .
