 
bruce's unique character ( i . 
however , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . 
in conclusion , the movie was well made , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven .
