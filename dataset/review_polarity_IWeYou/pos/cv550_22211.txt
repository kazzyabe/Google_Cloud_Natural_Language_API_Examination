 
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the " haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? " 
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film . 
 " what disaster is that ? " 
you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat . 
glad you asked . 
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie . 
note to sage -- you are still young . 
go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting . 
why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? 
would this be too much to ask ? 
can't we all just get along ? 
special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better . 
some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim . 
i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure . 
i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use . 
daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren't expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised .
