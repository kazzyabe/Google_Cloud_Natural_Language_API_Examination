 
i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . 
however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . 
in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . 
well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . 
like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . 
the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . 
again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . 
from there we go into a delightful parody . 
for once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . 
i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself .
