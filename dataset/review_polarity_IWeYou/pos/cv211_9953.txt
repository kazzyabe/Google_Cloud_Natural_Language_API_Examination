 
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . 
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . 
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . 
just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . 
of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . 
paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's " mad about you " ) . 
aside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while .
