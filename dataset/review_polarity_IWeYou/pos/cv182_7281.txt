the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . 
kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . 
kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija .
