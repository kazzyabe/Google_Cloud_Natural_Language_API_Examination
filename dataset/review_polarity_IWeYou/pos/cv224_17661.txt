 
the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . 
r2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call " driods " , or robots that are of assistance to humans . 
the plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . 
the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . 
the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . 
think that's enough ? 
on may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope .
