 
i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . 
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it . 
the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . 
however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian .
