 ? 
it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . 
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . 
yes , you read that right . 
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . 
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . 
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . 
the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . 
the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . 
of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . 
in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . 
i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . 
what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .
