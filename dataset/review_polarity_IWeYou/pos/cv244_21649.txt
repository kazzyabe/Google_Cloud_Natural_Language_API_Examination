 " being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more . 
it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . 
it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . 
even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing . 
other than that , i had a very enjoyable time . 
cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off .
