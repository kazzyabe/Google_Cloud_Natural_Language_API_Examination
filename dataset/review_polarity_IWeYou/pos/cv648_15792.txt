 
the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . 
so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible . 
but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . 
what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen .
