jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . 
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . 
he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . 
the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . 
melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . 
award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie .
