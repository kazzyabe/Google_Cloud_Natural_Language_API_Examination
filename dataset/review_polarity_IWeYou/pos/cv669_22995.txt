the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . 
playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . 
maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . 
if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . 
if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .
