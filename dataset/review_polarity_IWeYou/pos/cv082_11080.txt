 
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . 
the only real problems i had was the special effects . 
since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . 
 " drive carefully but recklessly " , mama , child's toy " the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise .
