are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? 
wafflemovies . 
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . 
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . 
battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . 
this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america .
