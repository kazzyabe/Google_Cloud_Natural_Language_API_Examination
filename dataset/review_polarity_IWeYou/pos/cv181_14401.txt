 
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer . 
it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . 
ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . 
i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year .
