 
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . 
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . 
unfortunately , unlike " the usual suspects , " we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . 
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . 
so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to . 
but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . 
perhaps that is the reason i docked the film . 
the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . 
and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .
