 
for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . 
but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . 
with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version .
