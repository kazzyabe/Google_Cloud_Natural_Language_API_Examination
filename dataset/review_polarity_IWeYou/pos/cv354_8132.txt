 
he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . 
so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? 
because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . 
she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , " what door am i at ? " 
and that gets her killed . 
but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing . 
i hate that show , i hate those actors . 
they're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't .
