 " last night " could have an " aka " tagged on the end of it that says , " it's the end of the world , and we feel fine " . 
finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . 
i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . 
his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . 
mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . 
my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . 
another problem is we never see anybody panicking . 
instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve .
