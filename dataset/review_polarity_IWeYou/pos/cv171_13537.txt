it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . 
i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . 
but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . 
i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
i needn+t have worried . 
why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . 
mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . 
approach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely .
