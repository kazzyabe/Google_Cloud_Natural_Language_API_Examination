 
the production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters . 
i believe the plot points are incidental , because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters , but still , you should proceed at your own risk . 
i won't reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not . " 
i've neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details . 
many reviews of " the deep end " describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder . 
days after my second viewing of " the deep end , " i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water .
