 
sex , and i loved might aphrodite . 
however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore . 
and bullets got some very raving reviews , but i didn't think i'd like . 
but i finally saw it ( double feature with ready to wear i think ) and hated it . 
i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews i wasn't sure if i'd want to see . 
thankfully i did ! 
people burst into singing and dancing , something i hardly ever like . 
that's all i have to say . 
really , if you think that is going to be a dull movie , you're probably dead .
