 
throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . 
to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . 
his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . 
royce ( what is his surname ? 
do we care ? ) 
almost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . 
his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . 
as we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . 
we don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . 
it's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not .
