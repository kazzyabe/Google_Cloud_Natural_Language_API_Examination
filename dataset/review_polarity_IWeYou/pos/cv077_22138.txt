 
although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . 
but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . 
the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . 
blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . 
this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .
