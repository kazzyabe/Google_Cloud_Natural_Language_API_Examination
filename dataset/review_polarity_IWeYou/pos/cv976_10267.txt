robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . 
a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because " i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . " 
all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . 
but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . 
upon my first viewing i left bawling . 
it is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected . 
the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . 
it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self .
