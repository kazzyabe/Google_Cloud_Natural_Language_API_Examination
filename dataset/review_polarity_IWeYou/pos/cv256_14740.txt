most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . 
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . 
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . 
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . 
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . 
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . 
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . 
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . 
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . 
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . 
disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . 
of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . 
does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? 
not at all . 
have i confused you enough ? 
if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most .
