 
the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film . 
gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through . 
i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .
