 
but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us " the usual suspects " . 
the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . 
because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . 
in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it .
