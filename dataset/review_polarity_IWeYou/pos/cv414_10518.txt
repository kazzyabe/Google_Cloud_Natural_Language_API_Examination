 
however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . 
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . 
pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . 
he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . " 
fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . 
there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . 
however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . 
we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop . 
go see the film and see what i mean .
