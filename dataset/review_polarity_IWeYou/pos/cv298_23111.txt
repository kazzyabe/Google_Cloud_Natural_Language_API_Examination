 
i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . 
there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . 
pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . 
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . 
 " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . 
the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . 
it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile .
