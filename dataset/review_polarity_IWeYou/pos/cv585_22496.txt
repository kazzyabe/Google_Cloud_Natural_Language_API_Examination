 
as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . 
however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . 
very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . 
this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get .
