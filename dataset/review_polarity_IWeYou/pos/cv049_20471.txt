 
i'll tell you i was . 
now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . 
now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . 
but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . 
ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . 
but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . 
one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .
