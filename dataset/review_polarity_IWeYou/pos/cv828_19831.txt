 
jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . 
american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . 
consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . 
after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . 
but i never used baked goods . 
but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' 
and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .
