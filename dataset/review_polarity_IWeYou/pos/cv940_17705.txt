when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . " 
what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? 
which is why i was pleasantly surprised by " edtv , " which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity .
