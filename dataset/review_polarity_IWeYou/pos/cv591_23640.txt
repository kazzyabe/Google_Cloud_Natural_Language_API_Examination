 
although it's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you don't know when death is coming . 
like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " . " 
the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way . 
by scare , i don't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ? 
the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .
