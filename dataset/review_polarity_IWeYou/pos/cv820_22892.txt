 
from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . 
from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece . 
miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . 
because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . 
the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . 
after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . 
his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . 
david mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them .
