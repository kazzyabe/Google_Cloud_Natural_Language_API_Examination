of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many " laugh-out-loud " moments . 
i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . 
and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . 
usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign . 
these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are . 
thankfully , just as your about to say " ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom " , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . 
like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach . 
you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people ! 
even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary . 
even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way .
