 
and i liked each film separately for which it was . 
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . 
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . 
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . 
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well . 
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . 
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . 
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . 
i will not ruin the ending for you .
