let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . 
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . 
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . 
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . 
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . 
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . 
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . 
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . 
but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . 
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . 
then we have denise richards . 
and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . 
i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . 
this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . 
last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . 
while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands .
