 
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , " what a hilarious idea for a movie ! " 
however , it was an even better premise for a drama . 
we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . 
it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . 
we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . 
it really makes you think . 
i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .
