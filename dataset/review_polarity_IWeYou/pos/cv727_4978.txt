 
 " you wanna cup'a'coffee ? " 
rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat-childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy . 
 " what're you ? 
a goddamn faggot ? 
what do you want from me ? 
where are my shoes ? 
what did you do to them ? " 
but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . 
 " we will soon be in miami " is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is .
