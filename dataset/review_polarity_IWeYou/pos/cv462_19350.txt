 
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film . 
the translation , " dream novel , " makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . 
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . 
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the " austin powers " version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them . 
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be . 
cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .
