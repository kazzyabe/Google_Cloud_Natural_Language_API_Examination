 
the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . 
fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good .
