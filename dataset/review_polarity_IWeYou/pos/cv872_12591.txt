 
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . 
although " the horse whisperer " has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . 
at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more .
