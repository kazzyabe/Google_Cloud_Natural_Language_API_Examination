 
so , i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . 
but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects . 
there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief .
