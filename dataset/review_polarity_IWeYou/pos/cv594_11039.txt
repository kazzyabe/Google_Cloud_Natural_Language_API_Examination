 
if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . 
well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . 
right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ? 
you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about . 
but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . 
as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . 
sandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . 
one scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears .
