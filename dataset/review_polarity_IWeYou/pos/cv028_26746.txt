 
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . 
the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying " the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . 
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " . 
the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . 
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . 
in the end , i can't call it a bad effort . 
in fact , if you haven't seen " the blair witch project " , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films .
