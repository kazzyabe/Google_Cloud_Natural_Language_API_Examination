 
the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . 
the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . 
we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . 
only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . 
i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .
