 
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . 
with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a " colored " person and his friends , the " non-colored " ones . 
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . 
if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle .
