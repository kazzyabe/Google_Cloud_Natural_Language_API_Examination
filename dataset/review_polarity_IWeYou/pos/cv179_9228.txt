 
throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like " the pied piper " ( passages of which are read during the film ) . 
for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . 
there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . 
though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter .
