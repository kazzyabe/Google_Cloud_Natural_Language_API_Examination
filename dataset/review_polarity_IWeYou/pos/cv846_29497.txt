 
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . 
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . 
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . 
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . " -it's 
like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
overdone . 
i also didn't quite " buy " the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 
i mean , c'mon . 
incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . 
it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one .
