 
in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . 
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . 
however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . 
needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . 
he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . 
at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . 
i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . 
as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . 
overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment .
