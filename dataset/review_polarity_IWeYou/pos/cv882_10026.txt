 
and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . 
he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . 
and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? 
 ( gee , i wonder ) 
of course the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . 
although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . 
what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . 
i don't know why he was put in there , and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse .
