 
you expected more , didn't you . 
the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then 
the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell . 
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on " coffee talk " sans dress and wig .
