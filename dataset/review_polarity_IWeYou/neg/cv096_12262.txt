 
he just doesn't " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . 
no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . 
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . 
basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . 
mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story .
