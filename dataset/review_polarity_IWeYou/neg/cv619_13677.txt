sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . 
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . 
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting . " 
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . 
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . 
it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered . 
there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . 
marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . 
so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .
