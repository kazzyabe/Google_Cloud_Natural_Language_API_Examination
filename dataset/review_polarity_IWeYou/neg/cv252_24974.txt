battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid 
battlefield earth 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare . 
behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . 
no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere . 
each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified . 
powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . 
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after " battlefield earth " begins . 
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? 
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? 
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining . 
the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's " the postman " ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be " the " big budget science fiction failure . 
often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video .
