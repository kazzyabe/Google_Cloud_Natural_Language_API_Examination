after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . 
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . 
it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , " i want to be in this movie . 
action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism . 
tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . 
seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . 
every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination .
