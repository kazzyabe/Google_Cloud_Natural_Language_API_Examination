 
if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . 
to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore . 
those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " . 
really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said . 
if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .
