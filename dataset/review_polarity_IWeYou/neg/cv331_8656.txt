 
if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . " 
well , i don't know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . 
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . 
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . 
but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . 
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us .
