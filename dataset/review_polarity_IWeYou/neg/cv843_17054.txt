starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen . 
the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary . 
note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? 
because you keep making movies like this . 
note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ? 
note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway . 
if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns . 
do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .
