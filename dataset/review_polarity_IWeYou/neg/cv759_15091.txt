 
that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . 
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . 
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . 
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
perhaps i will read the book .
