 
my problem is that we see all of these women in the film's trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ? 
seen the trailer . 
yep , you read that right . 
there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ? 
i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ? 
deleted scenes ? 
sure .
