 
the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . 
my vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . 
fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . 
in the film's supposed pay off scene , he exclaims " i was wrong , these are not men ! " , 
a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production . 
at the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions .
