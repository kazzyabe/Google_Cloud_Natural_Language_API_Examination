while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . 
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . 
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . 
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . 
admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . 
besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .
