this is the worst movie i've seen since the " so bad i walked out on it " " jingle all the way " . 
personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable . 
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist .
