 
if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . 
in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; " you are a @#$^% ! & 
choir boy ! 
you are a choir boy ! " 
those two lines marked the high points of this film . 
you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . 
this film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted " you are a ! $@^@ * ^ 
choir boy ! ! " 
for two hours .
