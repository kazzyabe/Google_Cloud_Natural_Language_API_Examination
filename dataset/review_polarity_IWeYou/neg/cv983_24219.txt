 
every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . 
all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend " i miss my son . 
people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . 
though i don't think he will win another oscar again . 
the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .
