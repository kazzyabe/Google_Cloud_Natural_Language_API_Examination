what were they thinking ? 
nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? 
robbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he's singing at weddings and having a good time . 
he meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . 
in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . 
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don't you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . 
maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino .
