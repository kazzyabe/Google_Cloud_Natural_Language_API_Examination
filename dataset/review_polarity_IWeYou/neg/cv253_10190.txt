hey , i've got a great idea for a movie ! 
ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! 
what's that ? 
sounds too boring ? 
ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain ! " 
looks ! 
what's that ? 
that still doesn't sound funny to you ? 
how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! " 
looks ? 
still not funny ? 
if you answered " no , that doesn't sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! ) 
you're absolutely correct ! 
for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . 
alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . 
it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! 
bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either . 
in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! 
now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . 
if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all !
