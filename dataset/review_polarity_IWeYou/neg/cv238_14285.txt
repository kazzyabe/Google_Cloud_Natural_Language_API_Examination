 
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 
we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 
it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film .
