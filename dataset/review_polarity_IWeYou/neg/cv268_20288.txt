as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . 
with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be . 
that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . 
even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . 
the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . 
when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? 
well now i know . 
seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit . 
please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .
