 
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . 
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite " black elements " : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . 
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . 
now , when i say it took forever to set up the " relationship " between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . 
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . 
the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . 
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . 
not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . 
oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? 
yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . 
this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .
