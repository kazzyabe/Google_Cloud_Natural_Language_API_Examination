 
therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . 
maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . 
while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . 
for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude . 
as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression .
