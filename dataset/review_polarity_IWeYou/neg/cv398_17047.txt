 
finally , i forgot about it . 
the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , " american perfekt " . 
having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release . 
and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort . 
i'll give you an example , without giving too much away . 
as he passes them , we see that his face is covered in blood . 
do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him ? 
you would think so , wouldn't you . 
and if you do rent it , don't bother trying to figure out what's going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end .
