 
i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a " cheese " factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time . 
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? 
uhhhm , you guessed it . 
critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture . 
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . 
we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . 
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me . 
i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . 
and there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks .
