whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . 
however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . 
once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . 
it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . 
however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . 
no , i think the audience might need them more .
