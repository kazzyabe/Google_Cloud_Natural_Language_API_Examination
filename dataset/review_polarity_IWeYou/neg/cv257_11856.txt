 
 " what a great movie , " exclaimed one gent at the urinal , " everything was so true ! " 
 " yeah , " laughed a man standing next to him , " i drive as slow as that one guy did . 
if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , " neil simon's the odd couple ii " may be just the film for you . 
if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . 
between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs . 
it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise .
