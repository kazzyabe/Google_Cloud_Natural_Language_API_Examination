ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . 
while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra " --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . 
the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . 
as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves .
