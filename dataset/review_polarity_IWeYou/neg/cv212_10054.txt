 
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts . 
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson . 
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . 
if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet .
