 
i suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . 
they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . 
as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . 
unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining . 
you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . 
this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying .
