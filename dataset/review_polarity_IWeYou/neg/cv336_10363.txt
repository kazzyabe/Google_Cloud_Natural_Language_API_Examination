 
tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie . 
as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . 
 ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days .
