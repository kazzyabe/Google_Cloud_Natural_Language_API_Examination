 
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect . 
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed . 
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again . 
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot . 
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films . 
trust me , i looked hard to find some . 
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . 
i wanted to like this film more than i did . 
i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening . 
bryan singer's " the usual suspects " for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . 
also , there is the underrated " jacob's ladder , " with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . 
well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .
