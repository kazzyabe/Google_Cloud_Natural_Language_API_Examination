 
soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . 
they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . 
he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like " i really don't like that guy " every time he fails to kill luc .
