at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . 
we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . 
it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . 
it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . 
times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . 
it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story .
