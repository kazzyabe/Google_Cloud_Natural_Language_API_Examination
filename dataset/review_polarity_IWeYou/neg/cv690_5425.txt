i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder . 
i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . 
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . 
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place . 
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids . 
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . 
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago . 
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him " wear " his spoon ( " you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . 
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( " your i . 
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself . 
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization . 
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened . reviews : 710
