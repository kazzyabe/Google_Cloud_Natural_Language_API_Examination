 
oh , how i wish you had heard them . 
oh how i wish someone had stopped him . 
in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . 
when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing . 
then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . 
then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous " since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing " moments ) . 
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . 
other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . 
now as for you mr .
