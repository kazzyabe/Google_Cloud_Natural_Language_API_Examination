ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . 
unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . 
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . 
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . 
instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .
