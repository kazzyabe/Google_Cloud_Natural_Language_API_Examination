there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . 
i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . 
it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . 
in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . 
i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . 
just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point .
