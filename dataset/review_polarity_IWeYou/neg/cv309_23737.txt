 
duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along . 
since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny . 
bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi .
