 
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . 
i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . 
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . 
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . 
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . 
the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . 
now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . 
one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . 
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 
the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . 
in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . 
i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least .
