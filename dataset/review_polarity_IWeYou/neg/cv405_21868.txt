 
it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . 
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . 
there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . 
when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . 
it's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign .
