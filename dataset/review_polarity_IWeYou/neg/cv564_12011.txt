 
and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . 
the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . 
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . 
suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . 
but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . 
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . 
at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' 
then i realized he was , and i was watching it . 
not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . 
late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably .
