 
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . 
but you could definitely do better . 
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like " there's chun li ! ! " 
or " look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega " . 
if you like light-hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one . 
it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia's last performance , or if you can't get enough of van damme . 
other than that , you could find better action flicks .
