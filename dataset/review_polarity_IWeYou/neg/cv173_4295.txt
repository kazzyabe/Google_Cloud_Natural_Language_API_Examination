i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . 
luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! 
i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . 
well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie . 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . 
 ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .
