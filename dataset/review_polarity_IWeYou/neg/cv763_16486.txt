 
usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . 
but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . 
all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . 
with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . 
unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . 
this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face .
