 
the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it . 
cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures . 
at least , i * think * that's what they do . 
i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't . 
the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . 
but " virus " , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster . 
 " virus " is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . 
for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! 
now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . 
if it's a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) " aliens " .
