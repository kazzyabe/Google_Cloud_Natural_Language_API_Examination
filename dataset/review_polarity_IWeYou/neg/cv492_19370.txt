 
i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original . 
i wish i had stuck to my first impression . 
for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show . 
certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) . ' 
if you see the film and you find you're not laughing , there is nothing wrong with you . 
it just means you grew up since seventh grade .
