 
back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . 
eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . 
eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . 
peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! " 
at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . 
what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .
