 
let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie . 
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie . 
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it . 
you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better . 
just don't be too upset if you can't find it .
