 
hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . 
nice to see you , jim . 
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . 
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . 
wh : can we guess who wins ? 
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score . 
jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . 
wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ? 
jb : that's right .
