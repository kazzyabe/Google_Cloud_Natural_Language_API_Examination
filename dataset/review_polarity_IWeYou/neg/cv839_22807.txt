isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than " it sucks " ? 
one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . 
one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . 
evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . 
to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why . 
i just remember that i didn't care . 
i'm not even sure i can call what's here " performances , " though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . 
and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova .
