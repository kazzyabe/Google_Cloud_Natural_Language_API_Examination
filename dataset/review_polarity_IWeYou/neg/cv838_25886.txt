 
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . 
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . 
i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . 
the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . 
but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . 
as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects .
