 
a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . 
while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . 
but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . 
at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . 
since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive . 
if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . 
nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . 
the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning .
