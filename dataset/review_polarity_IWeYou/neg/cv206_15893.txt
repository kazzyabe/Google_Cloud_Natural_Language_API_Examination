this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . 
maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence . 
i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . 
 * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . 
it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . 
i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy .
