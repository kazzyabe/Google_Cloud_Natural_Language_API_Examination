it's in , dare i say it ? 
l . 
there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone . that we see get destroyed . 
as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best . 
but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on . 
if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . 
if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this . 
but i warned you .
