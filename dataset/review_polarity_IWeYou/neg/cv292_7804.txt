 
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . 
see if you can follow this . i covered my face . 
hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet . 
there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it . 
there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words . 
 ( actual dialogue excerpt : " fuck you . " 
 " what ? " 
 " you heard me : fuck * you * . " 
 " no : fuck * you * ! " ) 
look . 
i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess , i'd get laughed out of the office . 
anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better .
