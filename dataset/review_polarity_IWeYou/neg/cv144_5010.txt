 
the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . 
in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . 
the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . 
and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . 
but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble .
