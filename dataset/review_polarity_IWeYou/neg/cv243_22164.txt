i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . 
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . 
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . 
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . 
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . 
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . 
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .
