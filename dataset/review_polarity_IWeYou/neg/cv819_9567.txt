 
who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? 
unless you saw " blown away " . 
 " the specliast " of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . 
now let's guess who we'd rather see naked , okay ? 
stone's small but perky breasts , which we've seen more times than harvey keitel's dick , or stallone's veiny ass , which isn't usually shown for a very good reason ? 
i know i can't really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . 
i mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . 
skip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger's accent , or see stone's breasts again .
