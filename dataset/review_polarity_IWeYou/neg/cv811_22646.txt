when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . 
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . 
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie . 
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . 
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . 
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . 
then we have the set . 
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . 
then we have the actors . 
my advice ? 
if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . 
if it's scares you want , rent halloween .
