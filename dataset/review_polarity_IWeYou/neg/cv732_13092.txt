 
nevertheless , i will try . 
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1 . 
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of " the black ooze , " what it is and what it wants . 
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not . 
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think . 
however , i rather liked that about the series . 
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . 
it is the proverbial " blank screen " which we project our minds on . 
how true that is when we see the " explicit " x-files - there is nothing there . koven
