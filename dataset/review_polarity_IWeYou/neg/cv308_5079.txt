 
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . 
here's what murphy thinks : " i think the audience is expecting a good time . 
here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense ) . 
each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . 
of course , i've already mentioned that i didn't care for murphy's character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties .
