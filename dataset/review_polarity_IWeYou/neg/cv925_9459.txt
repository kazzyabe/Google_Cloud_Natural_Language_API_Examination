 
no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the " cryin' " video . 
i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in " flirting with disaster . 
like we care about any of the characters . 
the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she's alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . 
so i guess she's some kind of mystery or something . 
i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film .
