 
you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them . 
 " i am not a whore ! 
i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing . 
there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . 
 " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . 
occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you . 
i see that you're hiding " - " from what ? " 
- " from you " . 
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas' pathetic dialogue .
