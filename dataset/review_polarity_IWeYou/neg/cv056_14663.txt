right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . 
aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . 
nothing that you can't get from any cop film .

but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . 
at times , i was hoping to see it .
