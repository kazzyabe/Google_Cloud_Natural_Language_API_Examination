 
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . 
we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? 
and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . 
as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . 
bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .
