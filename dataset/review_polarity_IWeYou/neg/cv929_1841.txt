 
review ====== 
well , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages . 
however , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film . 
some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ? 
arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love . ) 
so what is good about the movie ? 
well as i said there are a few amusing moments . 
surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . 
watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .
