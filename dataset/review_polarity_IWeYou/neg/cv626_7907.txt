 
if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . 
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . 
crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . 
better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .
