 
we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . 
the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . 
how do we know she's evil ? 
she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . 
before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .
