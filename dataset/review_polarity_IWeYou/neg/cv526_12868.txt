 
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot . 
now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . 
there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . 
the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park " , but with none of that film's suspense or tension .
