 " 
now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some . 
simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . 
i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . 
if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . 
now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in . 
all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . 
now you may be saying , " what kind of critic is he ? , " 
and you're right . 
as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance .
