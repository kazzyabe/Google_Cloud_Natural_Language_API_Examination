where do i begin ? 
okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . 
if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out . 
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life . " 
unfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway . 
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . 
so i stayed . 
of course , i recommend the same for everyone . 
troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the " do you want to know more ? " 
commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . 
but i do admit it . 
so , if you're willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it . 
of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don't recommend it . 
but guess what ? 
alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away . 
if you really want to see alien warfare that's played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection .
