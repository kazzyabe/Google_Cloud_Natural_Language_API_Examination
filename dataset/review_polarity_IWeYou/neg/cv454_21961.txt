 
at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . 
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . 
quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble .
