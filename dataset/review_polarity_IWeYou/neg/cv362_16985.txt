thank you ! ) 
varsity blues was produced by mtv , and it really shows . 
all you , as the main character , want to do , however , is read " slaughterhouse five " and attend brown university in the fall . 
 ( " you dawn't own mah life ! " 
who would want to ? ) 
jon voight , the stock evil guy in countless other movies , is , surprise , the stock evil guy here . 
maybe i'm just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it , even though it was dollar night at the cinema . 
i wished i had thought of that .
