 
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all . 
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that . 
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names . 
he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable . 
the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance . 
martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 . 
the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from " i want candy " to " tainted love . " 
the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s . 
during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , " is there a reason to this ? 
is there any moral story ? 
is there a point ? 
are any of the events going on in the film necessary ? 
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? " 
the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over .
