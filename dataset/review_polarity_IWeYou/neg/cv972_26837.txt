based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . 
what makes us human ? 
the thoughts ? 
the emotions ? 
is it possible to become human ? 
at what point can we say to a robot " now you are one of us " ? 
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . 
when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question " when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? " , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . 
the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . 
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference . 
now is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . 
for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's " 20 000 leagues under the sea " , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality . i .
