 
it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time " shattered image " runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care . 
of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . 
lines like : 
 " you don't beg , you insist . 
to her cat ! 
and : 
 " you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . " 
huh ? 
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : 
 " if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . " 
 " i don't have that kind of time . " 
talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say " point of no return .
