starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . 
so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . 
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 
well , it must have to the producers of junior . 
 ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . 
am i being too hard on this film ? 
i don't think so . 
if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents .
