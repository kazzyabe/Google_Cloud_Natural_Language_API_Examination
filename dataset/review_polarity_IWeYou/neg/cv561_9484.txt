 
while this worked in , say , " the towering inferno , " it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ? 
guess again . 
not only is it hokey , but you don't care about any character . 
who cares if heston dies ? 
who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? 
who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? " 
who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? 
and who cares about that whole plane spiel ? 
if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? " 
is . 
i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome .
