 " in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . 
don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . 
this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . 
at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste .
