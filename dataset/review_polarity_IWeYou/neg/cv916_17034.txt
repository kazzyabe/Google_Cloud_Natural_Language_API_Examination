 
and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad . 
 ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad ) . 
how many times have we seen this storyline ? 
as cook comments near the end of the film , " it's kind of like " pretty woman " , except without the prostitution " . 
i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said . 
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was . 
the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here . 
were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ? 
i don't think so . 
it appears to be telling them , " hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are . 
if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron .
