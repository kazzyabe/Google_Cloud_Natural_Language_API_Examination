 
how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? 
the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . 
i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . 
so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . 
bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you've seen in movies just like this one before . 
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past .
