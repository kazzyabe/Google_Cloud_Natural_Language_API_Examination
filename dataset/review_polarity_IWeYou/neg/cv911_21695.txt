 
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . 
he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . 
even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . 
one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . 
maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . 
its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . 
it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . 
i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . 
being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers .
