 
even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . 
with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .
