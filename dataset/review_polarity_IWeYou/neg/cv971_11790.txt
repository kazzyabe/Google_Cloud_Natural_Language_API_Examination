 
 ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat . 
amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . 
put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . 
just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill . 
its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag .
