 
i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . 
judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . 
loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , " that is * not * possible * .
