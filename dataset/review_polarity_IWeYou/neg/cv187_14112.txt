 
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business . 
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses . 
in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . 
frankly , i don't care . 
everything else i said was just padding .
