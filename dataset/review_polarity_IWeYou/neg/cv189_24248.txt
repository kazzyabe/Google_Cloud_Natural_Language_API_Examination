 we have a serious problem . 
as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake . 
it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but " lost in space " is actually better . 
it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 . 
if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film .
