but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it .

as i said , this film has no balls . 
but after a couple months , we all move on to the next " event " film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure .
