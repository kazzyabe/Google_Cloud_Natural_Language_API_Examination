ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . 
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds . 
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . 
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . 
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it . 
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . 
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . 
is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ? 
don't waste your money .
