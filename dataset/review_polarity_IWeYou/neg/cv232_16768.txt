 
the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . 
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author . 
so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits . 
when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained .
