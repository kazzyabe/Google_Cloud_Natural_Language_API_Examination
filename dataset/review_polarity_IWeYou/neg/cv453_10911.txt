i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . 
the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review . 
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him . 
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
at the extreme . 
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . 
i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .
