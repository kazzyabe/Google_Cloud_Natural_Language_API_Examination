 
now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . 
all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . 
in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . 
she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . 
nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie .
