 
like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor . 
they add up to zip , because they're not happening to people we care about . 
when we don't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ? 
especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ? 
 ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : " if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! " ) 
one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with . 
i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ?
