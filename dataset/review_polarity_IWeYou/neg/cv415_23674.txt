it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . 
that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . 
if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . 
after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . 
instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . 
but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . 
so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ? 
looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .
