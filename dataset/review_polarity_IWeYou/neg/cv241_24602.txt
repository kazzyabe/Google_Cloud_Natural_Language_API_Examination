 
watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . 
you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . 
at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! " 
i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film . 
looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . 
if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel .
