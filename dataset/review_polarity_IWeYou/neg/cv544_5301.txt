i'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don't watch skin deep . 
i never saw edwards' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . 
zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . 
consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . 
in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . 
because we don't care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail .
