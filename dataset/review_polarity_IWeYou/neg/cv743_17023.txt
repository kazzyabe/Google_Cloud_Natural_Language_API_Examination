 
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . 
despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . 
this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . 
in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . 
quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . 
we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . 
>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . 
quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . 
as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . 
and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs .
