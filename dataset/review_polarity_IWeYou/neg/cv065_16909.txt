 
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . 
like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character . 
hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . 
that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous . 
his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don't learn anything about him . 
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? 
it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage .
