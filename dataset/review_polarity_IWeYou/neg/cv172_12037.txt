watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . 
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . 
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . 
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . 
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . 
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . 
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . 
 " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line . 
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . 
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family . 
but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . 
still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards .
