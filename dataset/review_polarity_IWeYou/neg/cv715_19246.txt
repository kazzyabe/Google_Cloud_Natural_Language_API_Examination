if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for " wild wild west , " the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae . 
this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . 
there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look .
