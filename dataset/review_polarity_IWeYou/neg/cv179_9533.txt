 
rather , you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in , that you stop caring about who lives , who dies and where the story goes . 
instead , you become more interested in how the characters get killed off . 
someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : " i know what you did last summer . 
it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don't walk towards them yelling " hello " . 
once you yell " hello " , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse .

the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i'm not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks . 
the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it .
