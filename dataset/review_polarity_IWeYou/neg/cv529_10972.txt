 
but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . 
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino . 
 ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a " damn you mcbain ! " 
i hear from springfield way ? ) 
so the movie is cliched . 
big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? 
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . 
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .
