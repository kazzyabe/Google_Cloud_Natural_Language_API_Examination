 that's 
more like it ! 
and how , you may ask ? 
well , it's simple really . 
four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world ( oh my god , i just found out that the actresses playing the parts are models in real life . ) , in a plot so stupid and far-fetched , that you have to wonder once more , how crap like this gets by the hollywood bigwigs . 
hey , i'm actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here , but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time . you 
get the picture ! 
anyhoo , freddie prinze jr . 
monica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit . well , 
thanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! 
so why the three points out of ten , you may ask ? 
well , it's simple really . 
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film , who spared us any long sorted story , and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage , so that we could run out as fast as we can , grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is . i 
mean , head over heels . 
ps : didja notice how i didn't even mention rear window once in my entire review ? 
i didn't want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing , but then again , i just did mention it , but i guess it doesn't count in the ps section . i have a headache ! 
 ( i think my brain is coming back to life ) 
where's joblo coming from ?
