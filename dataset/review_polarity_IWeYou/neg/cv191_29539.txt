 
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . " 
to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done . 
but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse . 
they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , " oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . 
but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .
