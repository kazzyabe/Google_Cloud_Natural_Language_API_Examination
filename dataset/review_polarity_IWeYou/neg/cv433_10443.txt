 
for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . 
from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . 
to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . 
stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him .
