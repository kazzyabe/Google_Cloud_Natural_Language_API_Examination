starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . 
that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . 
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . 
she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . 
the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . 
although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . 
if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original .
