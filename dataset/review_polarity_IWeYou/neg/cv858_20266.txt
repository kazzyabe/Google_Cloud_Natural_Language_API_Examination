 
if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . 
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . 
but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . 
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . 
unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . 
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . 
things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . 
ever heard of lili taylor ? 
before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . 
as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . 
but , we get zilch for the other four .
