 " i would appreciate it if you didn't do that again . 
now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself . 
li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question . 
 " kiss of the dragon " is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . 
this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . 
i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . 
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . 
no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .
