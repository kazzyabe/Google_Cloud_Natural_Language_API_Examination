 
the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it . 
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , " wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . " 
 ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . 
if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending . instead of saying " i do " in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says " i'm gay . 
finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . " 
it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . 
by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . 
 ( much like this review you are saying ) 
overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets .
