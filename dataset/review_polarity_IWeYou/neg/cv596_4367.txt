 
until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . 
carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . 
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself .
