 
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible . 
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . 
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . 
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . 
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , " no , that would be far too tasteless . 
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . 
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . 
if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . 
it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . 
i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . 
and if you're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it .
