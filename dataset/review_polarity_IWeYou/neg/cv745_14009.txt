 
after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without " appeal " . 
that's about as much of a plot as we have . 
there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it . 
things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . 
admittedly i haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades .
