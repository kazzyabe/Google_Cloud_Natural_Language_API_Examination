 
it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill . 
too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . 
at least i would have been forgiving . 
now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic . 
well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago . 
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil . 
was i grossed out ? 
yes . 
did i get spooked a few times ? 
yes . 
jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore . 
the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up . 
pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante's peak " three times for him : ) . 
all right , i concede . 
there were a couple of things i enjoyed . 
and the machine they used to drive geoffrey's character mad ( see , i don't even remember their names ) . 
thank god they didn't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .
