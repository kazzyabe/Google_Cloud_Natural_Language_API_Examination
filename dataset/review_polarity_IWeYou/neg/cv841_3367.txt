 
still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . 
and after it , i still can't . 
paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy " mad about you " persona , but he does it well . 
any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue .
