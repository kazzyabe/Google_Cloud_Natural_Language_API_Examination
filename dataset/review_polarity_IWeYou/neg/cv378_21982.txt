 
by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low . 
 " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! " 
 " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass .
