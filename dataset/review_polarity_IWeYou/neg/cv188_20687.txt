 
you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . 
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . 
for your amusement , i will explain the plot . 
other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . 
then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . 
instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . 
or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters .
