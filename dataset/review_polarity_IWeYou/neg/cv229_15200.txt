 
on the basis of his first two cds ( " they're all gonna laugh at you ! " 
and " what the hell happened to me ? " ) , 
he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . 
but when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn't the same . 
in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . 
if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you .
