have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? 
well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . 
but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . 
despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . 
how bad is this movie ? 
i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test .
