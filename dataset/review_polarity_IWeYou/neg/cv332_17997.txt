 
now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . 
and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them . 
 ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . 
man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is . 
a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again .
