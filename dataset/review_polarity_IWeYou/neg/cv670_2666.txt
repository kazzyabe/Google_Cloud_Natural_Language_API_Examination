 
after seeing the movie speed twice recently , i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatt's life pass before my eyes in real time . 
 " i now pronounce you husband and wife . 
can you say poor editing ? 
everyone looks ugly in this movie . 
when you shoot people from under their chins , they look like they have double chins . 
if you have to see this movie just for his performance , go into the theatre at the movie's halfway mark . 
i though that jamie gertz played wyatt's third wife , but i later heard that her name is joanna going . 
this is the worst movie that i have seen in years . 
go see maverick if you want to see a western .
