 
boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment ! 
after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater ! 
read on to see what i have to say . 
it was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film . 
do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna's chest showing a classic film ? 
look for more of ken's kritic korner coming soon ! 
please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews .
