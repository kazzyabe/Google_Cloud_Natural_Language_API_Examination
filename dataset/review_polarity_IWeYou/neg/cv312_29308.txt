 
but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission . 
what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ? 
on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ? 
-- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits . 
any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity . 
one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? " 
kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .
