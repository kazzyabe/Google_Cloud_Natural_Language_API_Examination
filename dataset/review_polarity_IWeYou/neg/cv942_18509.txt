at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . 
another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to " wait " , and then he just rides off ! 
in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . 
my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . 
i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! 
will be forgotten about . 
i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing .
