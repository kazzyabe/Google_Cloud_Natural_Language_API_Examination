 
if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . 
if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards . 
and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick . 
oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film .
