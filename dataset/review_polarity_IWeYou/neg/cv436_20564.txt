chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . 
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . 
frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . 
the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . 
and i did chuckle a few times . 
sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been .
