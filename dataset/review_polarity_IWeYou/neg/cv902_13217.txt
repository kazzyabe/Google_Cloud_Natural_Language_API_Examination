there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . 
recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . 
to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . 
obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media .
