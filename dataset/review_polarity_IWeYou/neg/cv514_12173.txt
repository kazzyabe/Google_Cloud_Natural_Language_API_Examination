 
for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . 
goddaughter ! 
it's very bad to have paris against you . 
like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . 
despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . 
if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .
