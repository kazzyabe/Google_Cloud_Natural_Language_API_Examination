 
 " do you have a castle ? " 
sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . 
the real " star " of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . 
that's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won't believe the film's final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and " rosemary's baby " -inspired imagery ) . 
no , we don't see wright in the tub ( or fahey for that matter ) , and the gore quotient is virtually nil , so for a horror film " the sculptress " is surprisingly lacking .
