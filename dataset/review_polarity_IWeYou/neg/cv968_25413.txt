 
i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting . 
since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . 
instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them . 
still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora .
