 
ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . 
those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . 
so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind .
