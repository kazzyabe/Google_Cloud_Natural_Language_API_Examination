 
this is not a movie that i can easily review . 
and i loved watching it . 
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying " if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death . 
 " too bad we have to do it , " mitch says . 
here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used . 
if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one . 
the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) .
